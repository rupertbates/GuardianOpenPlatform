        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Arguments in favour of filesharing inevitably bring up the concept of free dissemination: of culture, of information, of ideas. Sounds lovely, everybody sharing, but these arguments ignore one crucial point: give and take isn&apos;t just about taking. If you move into a shared house, eat your housemates&apos; food, give it away to passersby and don&apos;t buy any yourself, you are contributing absolutely nothing to the arrangement. Sociologists call this the free rider problem. And free riders can only operate successfully when they&apos;re not the majority, because if everyone free rides then who&apos;s buying the groceries?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the same situation but with something immaterial ? say, an MP3 ? and people can&apos;t see the argument. As Alexandros Stavrakas writes, users of peer-to-peer networks contribute bandwidth. Yes, they do: to each other. That&apos;s still part of the &quot;take&quot; end of the arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have yet to read a sensible argument in favour of filesharing. If culture should only be created for the purposes of joy and enriching the masses, presumably none of us are allowed to have jobs in the arts. You must get a boring job. Any creating must be done out of love and if you starve, that will simply add authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who cares about copyright must be a cog in a gigantic money-grabbing corporation because there aren&apos;t any writers, photographers or musicians out there desperately trying to stop people from pinching copies of their work. And anyone advocating the free dissemination of culture is only doing so out of concern for the greater good. Which is why presumably you&apos;re all also ensuring unsold food from supermarkets goes to homeless people, and campaigning for the free dissemination of life-saving medicines, because if you care about people being given access to things they desperately need, obviously you&apos;re going to start with the basics, such as food and heating. In fact, I&apos;m impressed you&apos;ve still got time to argue for free access to MP3s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wish you filesharers would just admit the truth: you don&apos;t want to pay. Instead, you bang on about how it&apos;s fine to pass copies around because you haven&apos;t removed the original, even though the basic tenets of copyright law are founded on the idea that infringement occurs if you copy the most important part of the work (copying all of it definitely qualifies). Stavrakas says &quot;downloading a song, book or a movie does not deprive anyone else, including their &apos;rightful owners&apos;, of them.&quot; But you&apos;re depriving them of control over their own creation. Hey, how about I help myself to your car while you&apos;re on holiday. It&apos;s OK, I&apos;m not going to deprive you of it ? I&apos;ll leave it where I found it, with the same amount of petrol and everything, so that&apos;s fine, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, the Guardian published a handful of readers&apos; letters advocating free downloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Digitisation and the internet have turned copyright into an appallingly restrictive anachronism&quot; ? translation: many people think &quot;easily available&quot; should mean &quot;free&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Information technology gives us the potential to provide free and universal access to almost all human knowledge, art and entertainment&quot; ? translation: to help ourselves to anything we fancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Set against that loss are the millions of people enjoying music, films, the written and spoken word, computer software and access to information who would otherwise have gone without&quot; ? translation: actually had to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Despite what the music industry want us to believe, illegal downloading has a purely positive impact on everyone involved except the middleman: the soon-to-be-redundant industry itself&quot; ? translation: stealing benefits everyone except the people you are stealing from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you think it costs too much to buy a film, or a song, or an album? Why don&apos;t you film, or record, your own? You&apos;re not going to die if you don&apos;t see/hear/enjoy that one, you just want to. So create another. What&apos;s that, I hear? You can&apos;t actually make your own feature film, or record your own studio album, or write your own novel, because you don&apos;t have the resources or the talent or the time or the knowledge or the ideas? Oh dear. Better steal someone else&apos;s, then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is comment. GNM does not necessarily support the views expressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 356032814|2009-11-25T21:07:12|5763c4eb9ba1e7118e05ef6196e07877c55458b4 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Amy Winehouse opened her second album stating defiantly that she wasn&apos;t going to rehab ? no, no no ? then spent the next nine songs documenting why a spell of rest and recuperation might not be such a bad idea after all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this was the decade in which celebrities bared all ? thanks to websites, cameraphones, the pages of Heat ? then Back to Black was its musical equivalent, spilling gin-soaked tales of heartbreak, drugs and depression like they were going out of fashion. You Know I&apos;m No Good has our heroine crying on the kitchen floor, enduring tedious sex and getting caught by a lover with tell-tale carpet burns ? and that&apos;s just in the space of three minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to Black spoke a street-smart, noughties language (from scoffing &quot;chips&apos;n&apos;pitta&quot; to opening lines as gobsmacking as &quot;He left no time to regret/Kept his dick wet&quot;), but it was Mark Ronson and Salaam Remi&apos;s faithful 1960s Motown stylings that eased such tough tales into the living rooms of millions. Critics will argue that Back to Black is a coffee-table album ? shamelessly retro, lacking in musical innovation. But its strengths were never about tearing down sonic boundaries. This was articulation of an inner pain to rival that of her idols ? from Billie Holliday to Sam Cooke ? sang with an authentic soul voice that had the strife of a collapsing relationship etched across it. Put simply, the only thing Back to Black had in common with a coffee table was an edge. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This edge was to be Winehouse&apos;s downfall. In a tragic case of life imitating art, she ended up living out the worst aspects of Back to Black&apos;s subject matter, stumbling around Camden to the glee of websites, cameraphones and, indeed, those pages of Heat. But during the recording of the album, Winehouse managed to save her dark side for the music, combining misdemeanour with melody, scandal with soul. That she will ever pull off such a dazzling highwire dance again ? to come back from black, as it were ? seems a sadly distant hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buy this Sunday&apos;s Observer for the full top 50 countdown, plus an interview with the winner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 356033824|2009-11-25T21:07:12|212911ffeda66045f1f8b7eb7fc5235e99ba6428 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Speech Debelle has announced that she is sacking her record label, blaming Big Dada for the poor sales of her debut album. Speech Therapy never rose above No 65 in the charts, despite winning the Mercury prize in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wasn&apos;t disappointed that it didn&apos;t sell well, I was disappointed in the people I was working with,&quot; Debelle told BBC 6 Music. &quot;I wasn&apos;t on a big label and the machine wasn&apos;t there. So even though the album won the Mercury it was still only able to do what the label was capable of doing, which just means that I&apos;m more prepared for next time.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speech Therapy was released by Big Dada, a wing of London-based indie label Ninja Tune ? which also represented previous Mercury nominees Ty and Roots Manuva. Debelle has praised Big Dada in the past, saying they &quot;provided the best tools for me to craft my skills&quot;, but she now claims that their distribution network let her down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-Mercury, the rapper&apos;s sales were expected go to &quot;through the roof&quot;. And yet despite winning one of the country&apos;s largest music prizes, Speech Therapy has only sold about 10,000 copies. Compare this to the 300,000 shifted by last year&apos;s winner, Elbow&apos;s The Seldom Seen Kid, and you begin to understand why Speech Therapy has had the worst-ever chart showing by a Mercury winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, poor distribution doesn&apos;t explain why many of Debelle&apos;s post-Mercury gigs were sparsely attended. But Debelle, whose real name is Corynne Elliot, insists that it is label incompetence ? and not the music ? that has prevented Speech Therapy from becoming a blockbuster. She cites sales figures on Amazon, alleging a 4,000% increase after the Mercury win. &quot;The Mercury Prize was on a Tuesday, and the Friday there were no more physical albums in the shops,&quot; Debelle complained. &quot;So on the Mercury weekend, which would have been my biggest-selling weekend, people couldn&apos;t get it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Big Dada out of the picture, Debelle is already courting other record companies. &quot;One thing I&apos;ve learned is that having bargaining power is important. It&apos;s important to walk into a record label and say, &apos;This is what I have, and these are the kind of terms I want,&apos;&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speech Debelle will soon return to Australia, where she recorded her first album, to begin work on the follow-up. &quot;I want it to be a mix of Ray Charles, a song like Georgia, I want it to have the atmosphere of Pink Floyd&apos;s Dark Side of the Moon and the drums of J Dilla.&quot; She will again be working with producer Wayne Lo-Tek, as well as Faithless singer Maxi Jazz and British rapper MC Rodney P.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Amazing what a bit of success can do ...&quot; said DJ Food&apos;s Kevin Foakes, on the Ninja Tune forum. Big Dada has yet to comment on Speech Debelle&apos;s departure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 356033919|2009-11-25T21:07:12|7e961c19a051a91d2fbaa48a732bd604bc83b0e3 --&gt;</body>

Brown recorded vocals for The One I Love before his assault on then girlfriend Rihanna in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There&apos;s nothing against Chris,&quot; said Timbaland&apos;s manager, Marcus Spence. &quot;We love Chris.&quot; And yet Spence wouldn&apos;t explain the reason for Brown&apos;s disappearance from Shock Value II, Timbaland&apos;s third solo album. &quot;It was a mutually creative decision for both,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That decision was perhaps informed by the events of 8 February, when Brown attacked Rihanna. Since pleading guilty to assault in August, Brown has tried to resurrect his career, launching a &quot;Fan Appreciation&quot; tour and rallying musical supporters like Soulja Boy and New Yung Joc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to DOE, a rapper who also appears on The One I Love, the song didn&apos;t always have that name. Originally called Maniac, the title was only changed this summer, after &quot;some people&quot; saw a PR disaster waiting to happen. It&apos;s this kind of &quot;drama&quot;, a source told TMZ, that resulted in Brown and Timbaland parting ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shock Value II will be released 8 December, the same day as Brown&apos;s own comeback album, Graffiti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 356039823|2009-11-25T21:07:12|eaa2707ecaf8a9e7dc4ca7d19ede327c357a0bc9 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;I started All Tomorrow&apos;s Parties 10 years ago because I wanted to give people an alternative to Reading and Glastonbury. When we started the event, a booker for one of the bigger festivals declared ATP would go down like a lead balloon: &quot;Who in their right mind would pay £100 to go to an out-of-season holiday camp to see a load of indie bands that no one has heard of?&quot;   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn&apos;t easy getting this off the ground and I&apos;m surprised it&apos;s turned into a full-time job. But with three festivals a year in the UK, one in New York and offshoot events in Australia and Spain, we must have done something right to have kept this ship afloat for so long. Warp Films recently made a documentary about ATP (you can watch an exclusive clip above) and it&apos;s a fitting testament to the last 10 years of the festival. The film is a kinetic montage shot by fans and bands; a kaleidoscopic collage of Super 8, video and mobile phone footage. There was something like 600 hours of material to plough through, so the film isn&apos;t a straight story of ATP, more a collective memory. The director credit was shared between Jonathan Caouette (who directed Tarnation) and the 200 fans and musicians who contributed, who we called All Tomorrow&apos;s People. One of the fans who sent in some of the most amazing footage was Vincent Moon, who went on to become well known for the Take Away shows. We&apos;ve had him back to every festival since. It&apos;s a fast-paced film; we don&apos;t spend too much time on performances because what happens offstage defines the festival as much as what happens on (although full performances are on the DVD extras). But the film does capture some iconic ATP moments from the last decade, such as Grizzly Bear playing on the beach at Minehead, Portishead&apos;s first show in more than 10 years, and the killer debut performance of Grinderman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spirit of the festival has been captured perfectly. We don&apos;t have a VIP area or sponsorship, all the artists stay in chalets alongside the fans. Footage such as Daniel Johnston playing a set on the grass captures the atmosphere of a place where bands mingle with fans and there&apos;s an impromptu performance around ever corner. We also encourage all artists with egos to leave them at the door when they arrive ? there&apos;s a strict no?asshole policy. If you play and you act like an asshole, we won&apos;t ask you back, no matter who you are. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back at the acts we&apos;ve worked with ? from Ennio Morricone and Sonic Youth to Aphex Twin and Iggy and the Stooges ? we realise how fortunate we&apos;ve been. But equally important is the fact that we wouldn&apos;t be anywhere if it wasn&apos;t for the loyal fan base that has developed into a community of like-minded souls who share a passion for seeing great music and having a good time. So here&apos;s to another 10 years!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Tomorrow&apos;s Parties is available on DVD now from warpfilmstore.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 356044275|2009-11-25T21:07:12|ad2b831654c1f87c8c4744f1c59c05876df36ced --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is some debate as to how many of Arcade Fire&apos;s extended family members died during the making of the band&apos;s debut album. But irrespective of the number, death permeated everything from the title to songs about losing loved ones. And yet, more than any other LP of the decade, Funeral was shot through with a heady lust for life. &quot;Children, wake up ? before they turn the summer into dust,&quot; sang Win Butler on the thunderous Wake Up, as if reminding indie rock&apos;s risk-avoiding no-marks that glory only goes to those who dare to seize the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the release of the Montreal band&apos;s debut album, many acts wanted to be Arcade Fire ? Coldplay borrowed their stage gear and sound, while the Maccabees&apos; album Wall of Arms was all but a facsimile of Funeral. Except that while it was possible to reproduce the album&apos;s marriage of frenetic art rock and orchestral flourishes, cobwebbed chamber pop and disciplined bedlam, no one could appropriate its sensibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here was a world in which vampires roamed the streets, abandoned children crawled through tunnels to meet their friends, and sleeping was &quot;giving in, no matter what the time is&quot;. Some critics, seizing upon the band&apos;s esoteric lyrics, sense of theatre and Butler&apos;s anguished yelps, likened the Canadians to early Talking Heads. However, Funeral is one of those rare albums bold enough to disregard tradition and its impact is still being felt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buy this Sunday&apos;s Observer for the full top 50 countdown, plus an interview with the winner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 356053262|2009-11-25T21:07:12|cd8a3def600739d721db6a86c2fa7614b195f186 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hometown: London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lineup: Samuel Chase (vocals) and James Cameron (electronics).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The background: There was a great feature in the Guardian a few weeks back about dubstep label Hyperdub; it was one of those articles that made you want to put down the paper and rush off to download all the music being written about in it. The gist of it seemed to be that, like UK garage, which was a more accessible, commercially viable form of jungle, now 10 years on dubstep is being &quot;feminised&quot; or at least afforded the kind of accoutrements ? such as pretty synth patterns and vocal melodies from either girls or robo-male voices Auto-Tuned to the point of androgyny ? that might draw in listeners otherwise alienated by the music. Darkstar&apos;s Aidy&apos;s Got a Computer, Kode9&apos;s Black Sun and 2000F and J Kamata&apos;s You Don&apos;t Know What Love Is are exquisite examples of the increasing song-ification of the genre, ones that truly give the lie to the idea that electronic-based music cannot be &quot;emotional&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The XX this year posited themselves as a sort of dubstep Young Marble Giants, locating the common ground between post-punk, known for its dub space, and dubstep itself, all skeletal arrangements and jittery electronics. Whether by default or design, Samuel and the Dragon have, on their debut single, Diamonds On a Boat b/w Rising Up, produced two songs that in their rhythms and use of technology nod towards dubstep. They&apos;re quite striking. On Diamonds On a Boat, a recent Xfm record of the week, singer Samuel Chase ? who according to the press release had &quot;arty beginnings on the stages and in the galleries of Belfast and Dublin&quot; ? together with his partner James Cameron, whose background was in the grime and rave-era clubs of Leicestershire, have created a successful template for this new form of &quot;song-step&quot; or drum&apos;n&apos;pop. With sparse beats interrupted by the occasional synth squiggle and Chase&apos;s plaintive, look-back-in-anguish croon, it&apos;s like hearing Chris Martin singing over demos of the last Portishead album. Rising Up, mixing up the synthetic and organic, features organ and the distant hum of wonky bass, percussive clicks and bleeps. Because of the haunting, hymnal quality of the A-side, its minimal, brooding music and the soulful vocal, some are hailing Diamonds as a new Unfinished Sympathy, dubstep&apos;s breakout tune. It doesn&apos;t quite feel that epochal but it does point towards an exciting pop future influenced by dubstep production techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The buzz: &quot;If you thrilled to the XX&apos;s rich dubstep torch songs, you&apos;ll be all over this dreamy, slo-core synth number.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth: If you like songs where the gaps and spaces sound as immaculately produced as the music, you&apos;ll love this, even though we&apos;re not sure who the dragon is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most likely to: Inspire Chris Martin to duet with Burial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Least likely to: Win awards for their name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to buy: Debut single Diamonds On a Boat is out now on Moshi Moshi Singles Club. S&amp;amp;TD play at London&apos;s Hoxton Bar &amp;amp; Kitchen tonight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;File next to: Goldfrapp, Massive Attack, Alpha, the XX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links: myspace.com/samuelandthedragon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow&apos;s new band: Best Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 356057686|2009-11-25T21:07:12|2ea55adb4e9dce242117b5c85ab37f588438829f --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;I never knew HC Robbins Landon, who has died at the age of 83. But like thousands of others around the world, he was the only classical music scholar I had ever heard of when I was growing up, thanks to the major books on Mozart he published with Thames and Hudson, the lavishly illustrated and infectiously enthusiastic Mozart: The Golden Years, and 1791: Mozart&apos;s Last Year. I was obsessed with Mozart and his music as a teenager, and Landon&apos;s books were my passport to the world of late 18th century Vienna, which he recreated with a detail and a flourish that I found irresistible, and inspired my own journey of discovery into Mozart&apos;s music. Even his name, with those extravagantly Americanised abbreviations, had an air of scholarly glamour about it ? and sounds much better than Howard Chandler, his real moniker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barry Millington&apos;s obituary reveals how Landon achieved so much as a scholar who was able and willing to write for a mass audience. Almost uniquely in the field, Landon managed to break the often impermeable meniscus of obfuscation and academese that separates most musicologists from a wider public. Instead of insisting that he should be responsible for all of his work, Landon collaborated with fellow scholars and teams of editors and researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That openness means that his books are much better, even today, than they might seem. Although some inside the academy were sniffy about his commercial success (and Landon did make serious money from the multiple editions and translations of his Mozart books), both The Golden Years and 1791 did some in-depth investigative work on Mozart&apos;s behalf. Just as the myth-building and hagiographising of the composer was reaching fever pitch for the 1991 celebrations of 200 years since his death, Landon&apos;s work revealed what really happened in his last year. 1791 scotched at a stroke the idiotic notion of Salieri&apos;s supposed poisoning of Wolfgang, and rehabilitated the reputation of Constanze, his widow, who we can now see as one of the most assiduous keepers of the compositional flame instead of as a lascivious harpy, the conventional view of her. Landon&apos;s 1791 was serious, forensic scholarship presented to the largest possible public, and it&apos;s still a model of how it should be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Mozart wasn&apos;t even the centre of Landon&apos;s world ? Haydn was the composer he really made his reputation with, in a five-volume life and works, the establishment of the Haydn Society, and countless articles and editions. But Landon could be wrong, most notoriously in believing that six newly discovered piano sonatas could only be by Haydn, when they were subsequently revealed as fakes written by a recorder player. He also gave his imprimatur to Herbert von Karajan&apos;s digital recordings of Haydn&apos;s London Symphonies, which made me ? impressionable fool that I was ? buy them, some of the dullest performances of these life-enhancing pieces ever made. But without HC Robbins Landon, all of our musical and Mozartian lives would be the poorer. At the end of The Golden Years, he writes that &quot;In Masonic language, it was high midnight. One by one, all the lights of the temples were extinguished and darkness descended until 1918. The Mozartian era was at an end.&quot; The fact that the &quot;Mozartian era&quot; will now never end is no little thanks to Landon&apos;s work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 356057274|2009-11-25T21:07:12|cba900d0c446080d7a5def1a501d4de9df488031 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Greek soprano Arda Mandikian, who has died aged 85, was a powerful presence on stage or concert platform, appearing to be much taller than she really was. Her face was not only beautiful but awe-inspiring, like&amp;nbsp;an&amp;nbsp;ancient statue, with a&amp;nbsp;noble nose that seemed to start in the depths of&amp;nbsp;her&amp;nbsp;forehead. Of Armenian Greek stock, she was born in what was historically Smyrna, now Izmir, on Turkey&apos;s Aegean coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arda studied at the Athens Conservatory with Elvira de Hidalgo and Alexandra Trianti. Two English friends, James Matthews and Alan Collingridge, brought her to London in 1948. The following year she sang at&amp;nbsp;Morley college, Lambeth, and later recorded, for HMV, half a dozen Delphic hymns that had been discovered in 1893. They dated back to the first century, were etched in stone and miraculously contained vocal notation. The hymns brought her into contact with the composer Egon Wellesz, who taught at&amp;nbsp;Oxford University and was an expert in Byzantine music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also at Oxford, Jack Westrup, a&amp;nbsp;professor of music, heard her and engaged her to sing Dido in Berlioz&apos;s epic opera The Trojans, which was staged for the first time in its entirety by the Oxford University opera club, directed by Westrup in 1950.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following year she took the title role in a comic opera by Wellesz called Incognita, and in 1952 returned to The Trojans for a recording under the baton of Hermann Scherchen, released three years later. She sounds every inch the tragic Carthaginian queen, and her singing in Dido&apos;s death scene has surely never been eclipsed, even by Janet Baker. She then sang the Sorceress in&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;1953 recording of Purcell&apos;s Dido and&amp;nbsp;Aeneas ? a Gramophone review finding her &quot;sufficiently spiteful&quot; ? with Kirsten Flagstad as Dido.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arda&apos;s first three roles at the Royal Opera House came in successive months: as one of the nieces in Britten&apos;s Peter Grimes in November 1953; as Musetta in Puccini&apos;s La Bohème that December; and in the title role of Rimsky-Korsakov&apos;s Le Coq d&apos;Or in January 1954. She also sang Handel at&amp;nbsp;Sadler&apos;s Wells, and Britten composed the part of the ghost Miss Jessel for her in his The Turn of the Screw (1954, with&amp;nbsp;a recording the following year). With his understanding of voices, he&amp;nbsp;wrote a part that sounds like Arda, whoever sings it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She specialised in French song. I&amp;nbsp;recall in particular an outstanding account of Berlioz&apos;s Les Nuits d&apos;Été at&amp;nbsp;the Wigmore Hall, London. Although her voice was at its best in slow music, she managed to shine in the quicksilver brilliance of Britten&apos;s Les Illuminations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was an outspoken critic of the Greek junta of 1967-74, and for that reason her career was hampered. Offers from abroad were turned down since she feared that if she left Greece, she might not be allowed to return, and would not then be able to look after her ailing mother and her stepfather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the generals had gone, Arda went regularly to London until a recent deterioration in her health. From 1974 for eight years she acted as assistant director of the new opera centre in Athens, working with her great friend Christos Lambrakis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good friend, she was warm and sympathetic ? a dab hand at cooking a&amp;nbsp;moussaka. She was extremely sensitive, which made sitting with her in&amp;nbsp;an audience hazardous. A death on stage would induce loud sobs, a cinematic shoot-out would cause her to keel over as if she herself had been shot, and after a performance of Schubert&apos;s Winterreise by Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau she took to her bed almost paralysed with melancholy for two whole days. There were strong relationships in her life, but no marriages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;?

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;The ushers certainly had their work cut out. During this year&apos;s 250-gig London jazz festival, the capital&apos;s major concert halls tried to curb the increasing number of fans using cameraphones to record unrepeatable performances from the world&apos;s greatest jazz musicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miniature, silent, flashless, high-quality recording devices are almost universal, so it feels like concert-hall staff are trying to hold back an ocean. Although they often do this at the request of artists, they are nonetheless hampering a process likely to generate publicity for an underpublicised art form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sonny Rollins&apos;s opening concert at the London jazz festival, for instance – one of the 79 year-old&apos;s best gigs in years – could have been available for online viewing the same night, the way the American guitarist Wayne Krantz used to post his freewheeling jams at New York&apos;s 55 Bar before his fans had even returned home. Although highlights from the performance already exist, footage of the entire set would almost certainly further the cause of jazz as spontaneous live music, and impress Rollins&apos;s enduring sax-colossus status on those unfamiliar with his work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are, however, philosophical objections that an audience&apos;s ability to interpret live music is being undermined if you can store a recording and delay responding to it. That may be the view held by pianist Keith Jarrett, a legendary obsessive about unauthorised recording, who loathes the &quot;flatland&quot; of contemporary life in which so much interaction occurs through computers. More pragmatic objections claim that these developments detract from DVD, CD and authorised sales that pay the artists&apos; wages. But nobody in their right mind would rather to watch their favourite performers on an amateur recording than see them play live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s also a case for claiming that fans who are preoccupied with operating their iPhone can&apos;t really be focusing on the artists – like tourists experiencing breathtaking landscapes through a viewfinder. But we live in a multitasking world – those who are accustomed to it have no trouble surrendering themselves to the magic of a performance and operating a zoom button at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of cameraphones at pianist Robert Glasper&apos;s performance, perhaps because his guest was the charismatic nu-soul/R&amp;amp;B singer, Bilal. At Soho Pizza Express later that night, I couldn&apos;t see anybody recording young New York singer Gretchen Parlato, which is a shame because it would have been wonderful to relive her hip-hop-influenced interpretation of the Miles Davis classic Blue in Green. Likewise the frail but indomitable John Dankworth&apos;s emotional, alto-sax soliloquy on his and Cleo Laine&apos;s performace of Accentuate the Positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the BBC&apos;s sponsorship of the London jazz festival means that at least some highlights have made it into the archives. Jazzwise magazine has also been keeping tabs on the festival. But perhaps the time has come to let people catch as much of this elusive style of spontaneous music-making as they want. It certainly won&apos;t stop the musicians wanting to fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355993833|2009-11-25T21:07:12|298ecda1bf4c736d0b0ced1fdf15f329b1cd070b --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lady Gaga – Bad RomanceIt seems the Gaga may need a bit of a break. She&apos;s clearly being worked to the limit, and if the &quot;ra-ra-ro-ga-ga&quot; in the opening bars isn&apos;t a serious cry for help then I don&apos;t know what is. Not that you can blame the singer for wanting to capitalise on her golden moment in the spotlight, but her packed work schedule might explain why her latest assemblage of electro-beats and big, BIG chorus sounds like it was rushed off in about five minutes. In the hype that surrounded the release of the video – That hair! Those clothes! – it seems somebody forgot to mention that the song is pap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paramore – Brick By Boring BrickRemember how utterly dreadful your adolescence was? Well, if you can&apos;t, Paramore are here to bring it all back home. How depressing. With it&apos;s tumbling drums, shrieking vocals and rousing &quot;ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba&quot; battlecry, Brick By Boring Brick is the emo-strewn noise of raging hormones imprisoned in cloying suburbia. It&apos;s a sound that speaks to 13-year-olds from Arkansas, but prompts anybody over 25 to ask: &quot;Is this that Avril Lavigne?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erik Hassle – HurtfulSwedish singer Erik Hassle sounds like a male version of Robyn. Were we blessed with the same reviewing skills as Raygun (remember them?), we might even go as far to say he sounds like &quot;Basshunter and Mika in a lift&quot;. Of course, you may think you don&apos;t like this electro-pop ballad now (re-released this month after making the Swedish charts last year), but just wait till you&apos;re listening to it in the back of a cab after a late one. You&apos;ll be silently weeping at this homage to lost love.Watch the video for Hurtful&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sting – Soul CakeFar be it for me to speak ill of the dead, but this song was bad enough when Peter, Paul and Mary (RIP) recorded it in the 1960s. It&apos;s the kind of giddy hey-nonny-nonsense that gave folk music a bad name, so you can only imagine how dreadful it is now that Sting&apos;s got his hands on it. The Police singer lifts the melody and samples lyrics from the original for his own uniquely creepy-sounding version. And every time he sings &quot;Soul cake&quot; it&apos;s like fingernails being dragged down the blackboard that is your soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flo Rida and Akon – AvailableIn a parallel universe, this hideous construction of chords and melody might actually pass for music. It&apos;s probably the same universe where lyrics such as &quot;I ain&apos;t got no girlfriend ... let me put your number in my iPhone baby&quot; pass for poetry. And in this horrendous alternative reality no art is considered as great as that touched by the producing hand of Will.I.Am (he pops up near the end for a bit of a boast). The only thing that&apos;s worse than this song is the accompanying video, which appears to have been filmed on a child&apos;s mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355989155|2009-11-25T21:07:12|b060865c37b1628d84f88c9da9aa85f14d56ea0c --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hometown: Edinburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lineup: Alex Gardner (vocals, guitar).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The background: Oh well, that&apos;s Olly Murs buggered. If the idea was to launch him, on winning The X Factor, as a sort of latterday George Michael, trading in downtempo pop-soul and uptempo pop-funk, to fill the gap while Bushey&apos;s finest spends his days negotiating London&apos;s busy streets in his infamous all-terrain vehicle, he&apos;s been beaten to it. By an 18-year-old Scottish kid called Alex Gardner who can do things other than stomp about like a karaoke muppet in last season&apos;s Top Man clobber – boring old-fashioned things like composing lyrics and music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t get us wrong. Gardner has had help along the way: after leaving home at 16, Paolo Nutini rescued him from a life of penury, living on tins of baked beans and almost getting mugged in north London, when the Paisley-Tuscan troubadour invited him to support him across Scotland, leading to further shows with Mika and Paloma Faith. And Brian Higgins from wannabe hit factory Xenomania, which has hardly had any chart success this decade, is producing his debut album. They have been writing and recording the album in the mansion, belonging to Higgins, where Alice Liddell, the inspiration for Lewis Carroll&apos;s Alice&apos;s Adventures in Wonderland, used to live. After 12 months of working together, Gardner has signed to Universal/A&amp;amp;M, a company that has struggled terribly of late to &quot;wash its face&quot;, with misfires from nonentities such as Take That, La Roux, Black Eye Peas, Lady Gaga, Elbow etc. Poor Alex. He doesn&apos;t stand a chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the tracks we&apos;ve heard, Higgins and his young ward won&apos;t be pursuing a lysergic pop direction despite the historic surrounds, but they appear to have successfully carved a niche for Gardner. Less techno-ish than Erik Hassle but more dancey than Gary Go and certainly straighter and less playful than Frankmusik, Tommy Sparks and Dan Black, he could be the first breakthrough male star for eons. It probably helps that he makes Joe from The X Factor look like Joe from I&apos;m a Celebrity ... and has a voice that is simultaneously husky and smooth in the blue-eyed soul tradition of a Paul Young or, more pertinently, following on from the Caledonian pop-R&amp;amp;B croon of Marti Pellow. His songs are not to be sniffed at, unless you&apos;ve got a cold: first single Yesterday&apos;s News is as catchy as that Katy Perry paean to Sapphic embrace, I&apos;m Not Mad is his Fast Love, Heartbreak is like Technique/Republic-era New Order with a lounge singer, while There Goes My Heart finds a new pace for him – midtempo – and sounds like something Gary Barlow might taunt Robbie Williams with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The buzz: &quot;The pop-writing craft of George Michael, the looks of a young Elvis, and a soul-pop voice to die for!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth: Talking of white-soul team-ups with genius pop producers, Xenomania didn&apos;t exactly do the business with Vagabond, but Gardner seems a safer – and way cuter – bet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most likely to: Be tomorrow&apos;s news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Least likely to: Be found in a Sapphic embrace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to buy: Debut single Yesterday&apos;s News is released by A&amp;amp;M in March 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;File next to: Vagabond, Paul Young, Marti Pellow, Ollie Murs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links: myspace.com/alexgardnermusic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow&apos;s new band: Samuel and the Dragon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 356001552|2009-11-25T21:07:12|48e2ef1a4d87132a1a55ddd09d4116b0ecaaf0e4 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was billed at the time as his swansong. During a playback at his Baseline Studios in New York, shortly before its release in 2003, Jay-Z was adamant that after this, his eighth album in eight years, he was ready to pass the mic for good. But no one really believed him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hova&apos;s ambitious plans for The Black Album involved a dozen producers serving up a dozen different tracks. Ultimately this proved a little too ambitious even for him, but the finished product did feature all the producers du jour – Timbaland, Just Blaze, Kanye West, the Neptunes, Eminem and even Rick Rubin. Many consider The Blueprint to be his greatest album – after which even Jay-Z admits he &quot;dumbed down for my audience to double my dollars&quot; – but with an unrivalled list of heavyweights behind him, The Black Album was the more rounded, polished beast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the opening interlude – &quot;All things must come to an end, all things must conclude&quot; – to the final word, it&apos;s a gloriously epic, self-celebratory album. Even Ma Carter makes an appearance on December 4th, waxing lyrical about her &quot;special child&quot;. Jay-Z might boast that he&apos;s the &quot;best rapper alive&quot;, but few would disagree on the basis of the inventive rhymes and free flow that power the narrative. The rhetorical What More Can I Say breaks down at the end, leaving him in full dextrous a cappella, the sound of a man (supposedly) stepping out at the top of his game: &quot;Pound to pound I&apos;m the best to ever come around here, excluding nobody ... I&apos;m suppos&apos;d to be number one on everybody&apos;s list, we&apos;ll see what happens when I no longer exist.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It closed with My First Song, which brought us back to Jay-Z&apos;s debut single of 1996. Except it didn&apos;t, did it? He inevitably returned, and three albums later, has now overtaken Elvis as the most successful US solo star ever. On record, however, the encore has yet to match what was supposed to be his final word.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buy this Sunday&apos;s Observer for the full top 50 countdown, plus an interview with the winner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355965741|2009-11-25T21:07:12|458432c10b0fdc67ce5eacd0a74502e866f90dc1 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;When artists &quot;find&quot; themselves, it can pour water on their creative fire. This threatened to be the case in this anticipated concert, during which the former Cat Stevens presented highlights from his musical, Moonshadow. The story of a man emerging from darkness, Moonshadow began with a cuteness-overload: a boy and a girl from rival communities become friends and sing about it. But it only took the cast to burst into Matthew &amp;amp; Son to remind the audience why they were there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s taken him 33 years, but Yusuf Islam seems to have reconciled his former life as a prodigiously gifted singer-songwriter with the faith that gives him his second name. Looking like a stylish imam, he began the concert proper with the evocative The Wind, from the classic 1971 album Teaser and the Firecat. The voice is as good as ever, and just to remind us that back then he couldn&apos;t help but write masterpieces, he followed it with the hugely emotional Where Do the Children Play?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roadsinger, the title track from his 2009 album, was the best of the new material, but it was the classics that everyone wanted to hear, and Islam and his tight band gave heartfelt renditions of Wild World, Moonshadow and Peace Train. The older songs are all about searching, and Islam distanced himself from them when he found his faith. But by the second encore, with the entire audience singing along to Father and Son, he looked to be realising the value of those songs once more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Liverpool Arena on 5 December  (0844-8000 400).

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;As the print media struggle with the impact of the digital age, what is the effect of technology on live performance? Are we finally entering a time, predicted by that great maverick pianist Glenn Gould a generation ago, when technology supplies all our needs – when public concerts will cease, and the perfection of quiet communication from a recording studio will supplant the unpredictability of the live experience?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence points in completely the opposite direction. Public engagement with the live performing arts, sustained by years of investment, has never been greater. Audiences are&amp;nbsp;thronging to live venues, both traditional and challenging, from the new Alan Bennett at the National to choreographer Michael Clark&apos;s recent take on David Bowie and Iggy Pop. Shows are sold out across London, and this is only the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That engagement is heightened and complemented by digital technology. Arts websites buzz with imaginative life. Artists such as Robert le Page, Bill Viola, Simon McBurney and Katie Mitchell are ensuring that video, film and the interactive media are becoming firmly embedded in the art itself. This month, on the South Bank in London, the Philharmonia invited audiences to get close to Stravinsky&apos;s Rite of Spring by watching different sections of the orchestra on 20 video screens, with scores you could follow: never has the panic of that opening bassoon solo felt so real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology began as a very simple intervention in performance; the parallel to what happened with sound recordings is interestingly close. In the beginning, recordings simply captured and preserved the live event. But it was not long before conductors such as Leopold Stokowski realised the immense potential of the recorded medium, creating works such as Fantasia. At the start of the LP era, the producer Walter Legge created a lush, new orchestral sound that was superbly suited to the new medium – one that Herbert von Karajan then developed into an art form, glorifying himself. Similarly, the arrival of the CD in the 1980s, with its bright, transparent textures, was perfectly suited to the sounds of Christopher Hogwood, Trevor Pinnock, Roger Norrington and their perky period-instrument bands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video and television were originally just about capturing and relaying performance. Connoisseurs argue endlessly about the value of music television, but events such as the Last Night of the Proms have become embedded in popular consciousness. Now, with the arrival of free-to-air digital TV, more Proms than ever reach the viewing public – a privilege we take for granted. The high-definition relays from the Met Opera in New York to cinemas have been followed by the Royal Opera House here – first just outside, and now around the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today&apos;s directors are increasingly making use of live filming: no Peter Sellars production seems complete without TVs on stage. A stunning Viola/Sellars production of Tristan und Isolde, yet to be seen here, sets huge, ritualistic videos in counterpoint to Wagner&apos;s intense score; the two rival each other in power and magnificence. Last year, Le Page&apos;s Lipsynch built video castles in the air out of odd fragments on stage, so we saw more digitally than we could live. Pianist Leif Ove Andsnes&apos;s collaboration with a visual artist on Pictures from an Exhibition, one piano with five screens suspended around it, comes to London next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the cutting edge of this interaction between live and digital, last weekend the Dutch Toneelgroep company brought its six-hour conflation of three Shakespeare plays, Roman Tragedies, to the Barbican; the action developed over different areas of the stage and beyond, even into a nearby road, while&amp;nbsp;the audience moved from the auditorium to sit around the stage. What bound the experience together was the continuously filmed performance, available on screens wherever you were. Of course, not every experiment will be successful: a recent woozy and pointless video accompaniment to a concert performance of Berg&apos;s Wozzeck at the Royal Festival Hall showed how not to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one would argue that there is no longer a place for the traditional drama or concert. But the notion that technology distracts from the purity of the live experience no longer holds true. It also means that thousands more people now have access to live performance, either online or via broadcasters. Power is passing to the participants: anyone can publish their work on YouTube; the Association of British Orchestras has just published a booklet of new ways for orchestras to connect with their public, many of them via digital media. The funding that has brought all of these things to pass is one that will soon be under threat, under whatever government. Yet there can be few investments as life-enhancing, and indeed as necessary: what could demonstrate this more powerfully than the public thirst for the arts in a time of recession?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 356008530|2009-11-25T21:07:12|54cbecc9789ec7a6b551d909e8bbebf7a7ac63a7 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;The first audio samples have emerged from the debut album by Apparatjik, a side project uniting Coldplay bassist Guy Berryman, A-ha keyboardist Magne Furuholmen, Mew frontman Jonas Bjerre and producer Martin Terefe. The band has emailed a new song, Electric Eye, to just 30 fans, promising a full release on 30 November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apparatjik first appeared in 2008, recording one track for Amazon Tribe, a benefit CD launched in conjunction with Bruce Parry&apos;s Amazon TV series. However, they have kept working and, according to Coldplay fan sites, the debut album is imminent. The band are certainly putting work into their deliberately esoteric website and Twitter account, the former hiding dozens of videos, images and audio snippets. Since September, fans have been encouraged to submit their theories linking the disparate images and sounds – and 30 of the most creative have reportedly been rewarded with the first single.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though we haven&apos;t heard the single in its entirety, one generous fan has shared a sample of Electric Eye that we have dutifully analysed. Recalling the style of Belfast DJ David Holmes, the track&apos;s got a shoegazey parade of sequenced synths, moody guitar riffs and an unidentified singer. While it&apos;s clearly not Bjerre&apos;s usual singing voice, we&apos;re not used to hearing the warbling of Coldplay&apos;s bassist or A-ha&apos;s keyboardist, so it&apos;s difficult to tell who is behind the mic. Even more mysterious is the voice of Terefe, a man best known for producing acts like Martha Wainwright and Jason Mraz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what Electric Eye definitely does not sound like is a cross between Viva La Vida and Take On Me. And for that, we must admit, we are sorely disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355984158|2009-11-25T21:07:12|bba35780edc6d0112f5bc76eb9ea91f651304907 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;My husband, John Hilton, who has died aged 67, was a keen choral singer, a member of the Liberal Democrat party, a foster parent, a Camra member, a bridge player and a walker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two months after our marriage in 1965 John was ordained in Coventry Cathedral, but his career in the church was short-lived since, by 1970, he had decided to retrain, studying sociology at the London School of Economics. He worked for the next 23 years in social work, with the Leonard Cheshire Foundation, then in local authority departments and finally at King&apos;s College hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John had a mild disability as a child and, although interested, could not take part in sport ? instead he concentrated his efforts in singing and reading. He was a boy chorister in his local church from the age of seven, and then attended grammar school, eventually going to King&apos;s College London to read theology. During one vacation, he took a job at King&apos;s College hospital, where I was a physiotherapy student; I was intrigued by the bearded, Guardian-reading porter waiting to take a patient back to a ward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While at LSE he had joined the London Orpheus Choir and enjoyed singing in concerts in the Queen Elizabeth Hall; this was followed by membership of the Croydon Philharmonic Society and, after we moved to Dover in 1998, the Dover Choral Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John had taken early retirement on health grounds but did not entirely relax as we started a bed and breakfast business in Dover. It was not long before ill health overcame him and he was diagnosed with hydrocephalus. I survive him, along with our daughter, Sarah, foster daughters Tina and Gloria, six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 356007313|2009-11-25T21:07:12|d5860396a67fbfe908bbc90e45e5bb155f93f425 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Chicago&apos;s Tortoise might nominally be a &quot;rock&quot; band, but it comes as no surprise to see them closing this year&apos;s London jazz festival. When they emerged in the mid-1990s at the forefront of a movement unsatisfactorily dubbed &quot;post-rock&quot;, they started to creep on to the radar of arts council-funded projects, particularly jazz bills. Their music has some of the superficial qualities of jazz ? it is instrumental, rhythmically complex, harmonically rich and features the cool-school sound of the vibraphone ? but Tortoise have always been more about texture than harmony; more about grooves than solos. Even their guitarist Jeff Parker, a formidable soloist with assorted Chicago jazz projects, never solos in Tortoise. Instead he uses his instrument to create bleepy riffs and rhythmic effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the appeal is watching these strange sounds being produced. If Tortoise can sound pleasantly snoozy on record, their music comes to life on stage, with the band multitasking on numerous instruments. The tracks from their most recent album Beacons of Ancestorship, which ditches the mallet instruments to explore proggier, techno-influenced territory, here take on a muscular air, with two drummers facing each other as they beat out tribal Afro-funk rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The support act, the legendary electronica duo Cluster, were all about texture. Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius stood either side of a table, poking, stroking and twisting a baffling array of samplers and oscillators, constructing a symphony of dripping taps and Geiger counters. Some of the most compelling moments came when the 60-something Germans and the 40-something Chicagoans collaborated, with Cluster forcing Tortoise to rely rather more heavily on textural improvisation than proggier riffs. It&apos;s a direction that suited them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 356007691|2009-11-25T21:07:12|404df47eb0e03597d6b0f743f47c8fc91e5a1f89 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;It felt right that this barely advertised, but sold-out date was held in a former church. Much of Corinne Bailey Rae&apos;s forthcoming second album, The Sea, written since her husband&apos;s death by accidental overdose last year, has a hymnal quality that was heightened by the Tabernacle&apos;s tranquil atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rae has been out of action for most of the past 18 months, and looked nervous at this full-length return to live performance. Physically small ? just a cloud of ringlets could be seen from the back of the room ? and emotionally delicate, she inspired fierce protectiveness in the audience, who greeted old songs and new with loud approval. She thanked us more than once for &quot;being so supportive&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s trite to suggest that Rae has become a more soulful vocalist since her loss, but there&apos;s a depth of feeling that didn&apos;t exist on her 3m-selling debut. The breeziness of that album was occasionally present here in a life-goes-on way, lighting up new tunes such as Paris Nights and New York Mornings, but it was her otherwise sombre, pained delivery that made this show moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her band made much use of small, distinctive sounds including sleigh bells and a metronome tick, accentuating the yearning lyrics of I&apos;d Do It All Again and Love&apos;s On Its Way. While singing The Sea&apos;s title track, she seemed dreamy and tender ? and miles from west London. The No 2 hit from 2005, Put Your Records On, ended the show sunnily, with even the band applauding as she left the stage, but the spell of the aching new songs lingered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 356010029|2009-11-25T21:07:12|6262db6fede3f22ff56dbe293bd9b4fc300547d3 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll admit that I arrived late to the Grouper party. Liz Harris&apos;s Portland-based solo project has been going since 2006, developing from a drone-heaby basement act into what has become essential listening. Dragging a Dead Deer Up a Hill was the album that finally made me appreciate Grouper&apos;s magnificent sound. It offers a way into her dense, nocturnal world. Her inspiration comes from nature, but also the way sleep can offer respite from the harsher realities of life. With a somnambulist mood forming the basis of her work, it&apos;s surprising to find her songs are so intimate. Yet listen to Heavy Water/I&apos;d Rather Be and you&apos;ll see how she explores these qualities by using noise, distortion and drone to create strength in her quiet songs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same friend who introduced me to Grouperl went to see her live in London a few weeks ago. Harris apparently played for just 10 minutes, but instead of everyone being angry, they were left dazzled. That&apos;s cool. As Grouper, Harris has built up a huge blog buzz, which could have easily translated into a record deal, but she doesn&apos;t seem keen on entering a failing industry. In a recent interview she explained how her time in the &quot;Group&quot; commune (which informed the name Grouper) has affected her stance on the industry: &quot;The values the Group held went directly against most elements of the modern music industry, most of modern culture. Need for attention, lack of care for others, strutting like a peacock, motivated by money. It&apos;s like a cheap magic show.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Grouper you are receiving transmissions of pure art – her music is not motivated by money and she&apos;s not part of some frantic race to success in the music industry. I&apos;m hyped to hear that the forthcoming Vessels EP is due in January. Harris&apos;s new recordings, posted on Vimeo and MySpace, demonstrate a restless artist willing to push herself further into new sonic territories. Just check the Maya Deren-like, nightmarish dance of death video for Hold the Way ( embedded above). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video matches the music in an ingenious way. It doesn&apos;t &quot;feel&quot; like a promo vid, more another artistic artefact from Grouper&apos;s world. Gone are the acoustic vibes of her current album, instead her vocals evoke choral harmonies over heavy transcendental Popul Vuh-esque noise. This spooky nighttime anthem shows that Grouper&apos;s restless artistic spirit shows no sign of diminishing just yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 356004126|2009-11-25T21:07:12|35d85d2cc345a2495e71acb2aacb216721e05211 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Many have tried, but few have succeeded: Greek violinist Leonidas Kavakos attempts the impossible tomorrow night with the London Philharmonic, the start of his four-concert residency as the South Bank Centre&apos;s Artist in Focus. In programmes in which you can hear Kavakos as a conductor and director with his orchestra, Camerata Salzburg, as chamber musician and concerto soloist, Kavakos is searching for what he calls the &quot;source&quot; of music: the transcendent, ethereal realm that, for him, is the place that the great masterpieces come from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kavakos has even had a go at defining what this &quot;source&quot; actually is, and how it manifests itself in the music he&apos;s playing by Bach, Schnittke, Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Bartok, and Berg. There are four elements to Kavakos&apos;s essence of music: memory – the way a piece of music relates to other masterworks, or how a work memorialises or celebrates human life; silence – without which, Kavakos paradoxically but correctly says, there would be no music at all; folk music – traditions that our Platonic violinist sees as coming from the people; and Bach – every composer&apos;s favourite musician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there&apos;s one piece in Kavakos&apos;s week of concerts that brings all four elements of his source together, it&apos;s the one he&apos;s playing tonight with the London Philharmonic Orchestra and Vladimir Jurowski, Berg&apos;s Violin Concerto. (Always assuming that the LPO have recovered from the shock of their erstwhile general manager and finance director&apos;s alleged, extraordinary fraud. The orchestra has begun a court action against Cameron Poole to recover £560,000 they claim was embezzed. Hald a million quid would come in handy in these tough times for our major orchestras.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berg&apos;s piece is dedicated &quot;to the memory of an angel&quot; (Alma Mahler&apos;s daughter, Manon Gropius, who died of polio aged 18), the piece quotes and transforms a Bach chorale, &quot;Es ist genug&quot; (&quot;It is enough&quot;) in its final pages, it includes references to Carinthian folk tunes, and emerges from primordial quietitude to dramatise an existential battle of life and death. Kavakos&apos;s violin-playing has always been astoundingly virtuosic and blazingly insightful. Whether that&apos;s enough to qualify him as the artist-seer he wants to be is another matter, but whether you call it &quot;source&quot; or &quot;essence&quot; or some other place that passeth understanding, if his ideas inspire his playing, I&apos;m happy to admit Kavakos to the pantheon of musician-philosophers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355979252|2009-11-25T21:07:12|feee0e3aa582954830b8dcb2bed0373243f19e99 --&gt;</body>

Bono&apos;s going to lead a UN task force  on world poverty, the Edge is setting up a guitar school in Seville, and  Ringo and George are going to  retire to the country and count  their money. I think you&apos;ll find it&apos;s Larry and Adam. But no, the time has not come for a parting of the ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So one of them&apos;s married Patsy Kensit? Gone into rehab? Put together an exhibition of really bad paintings because he once went to art school? Why don&apos;t you just put us out of our misery? They&apos;re going to headline at Glastonbury next year!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that&apos;s worth an exclamation  mark because . . . They&apos;ve been &quot;going to headline at Glastonbury next year&quot; since the 1980s, but the closest they got was in 1989 when bassist Adam Clayton joined the Hothouse Flowers on stage for one song. Now, as the festival&apos;s founder, Michael Eavis, puts it, &quot;at last, the biggest band in the world are going to play the best festival in the world!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Were they planning to spend June in Somerset? They&apos;ll be travelling over specially from the US. Bono&apos;s big on the environment, so no doubt he&apos;ll be crossing the Atlantic by train.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you do that pretending-to-take-the-temperature-of-the-global-consciousness thing and pull out a few quotes from the Twittersphere? &quot;Who invited U2 to Glastonbury next year? Was it you?? I hate you&quot;; &quot;oh god no. say it ain&apos;t so . . . &quot;; &quot;U2 at glasto? i&apos;d rather circumcise myself with a blunt chopstick&quot;  . . . I could go on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please don&apos;t. Are we heading for  a repeat of Jay-Z-gate, with Glasto&apos;s organisers picking a headliner that most of the audience don&apos;t want to see? More like Cliff Richard at Wimbledon: no one admits to buying any of  his records but when he starts singing everyone joins in. Which bit of &quot;the biggest band in the world&quot; didn&apos;t  you understand?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do say: &quot;How long . . . How long must we sing this song?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t say: &quot;No, seriously. I want to go back to the tent.

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;The cricket bat on the cover, along with utterances about cups of tea and the Queen, announced that the White Stripes were a long way from Motor City for their fourth album. They also seemed, at times, a long way from the decade in which this was made. Elephant was laid down in east London&apos;s Toerag Studios for just £5,000, on analogue equipment built before 1963, whereas the sleeve notes boasted that it was recorded and mastered without using a computer. This stripped-back approach to rock&apos;n&apos;roll influenced countless Stripes imitators at the start of the decade, but nobody matched Jack and Meg when it came to creating a colossal sound out of such basic ingredients. Elephant, after all, was the release that banished preconceptions about the White Stripes&apos; self-consciously limiting format and affirmed that they were consistently and swaggeringly magnificent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their first recording for a major label, the 14 tracks had a gritty truculence that was still accessible enough to transform them from a cult act to a global concern. Meg White&apos;s guileless, tick-tock drumming style was the perfect anchor for the mangled blues and squalls of noise Jack White wrung from his guitar. Beneath the seismic grumble of Seven Nation Army or the caterwauling helium chorus of There&apos;s No Home for You Here were pithy specimens of songwriting craft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its heart was Jack&apos;s hankering to be born in an age when men were gallant and women swooned with feminine modesty. It was subtitled The Death of the Sweetheart and was rife with thwarted love affairs, boiling sexual tension and declarations of desire. More often than not, however, Jack came across as a rascally old-school chauvinist. Along with his mannered vocal style and the ludicrous insistence that he and Meg were siblings, fans gobbled it up as part of the White Stripes&apos; theatrical intrigue. This was the occasion when the Detroit odd couple triumphed on their own irresistible terms. Righteous fury, melodramatic wit, hookline-and-sinker choruses – it was all here, in one brilliant package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buy this Sunday&apos;s Observer for the full top 50 countdown, plus an interview with the winner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355999137|2009-11-25T21:07:12|b60972e8fa77aee4f764034287c110be189828e0 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Haifa Wehbe, a popular Lebanese pop singer, has always been a controversial figure. The queen of a relatively new breed of voluptuous, coquettish starlets, her provocative lyrics, attire and music videos have won her popularity among Arab men who lust after her, women who want to emulate her, and now children targeted by her latest album. It is in objection to allegedly racially insulting lyrics from this album that a group of Nubian lawyers submitted an official complaint to Egypt&apos;s public prosecutor calling for one of the songs to be banned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offending track, Baba Feen, a children&apos;s ditty shot in a bizarre Alice-in-Wonderland-meets-Teletubbies video, features Wehbe as a very sexy mother trying to cajole her young son into going back to bed – which he refuses to do unless she meets several demands, one of which is to fetch him his teddy bear and &quot;Nubian monkey&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This perceived reference to black Egyptians has provoked anger among the country&apos;s Nubian minority and the diva is now facing claims that the song&apos;s lyrics are discriminatory and are fuelling racist attitudes towards Nubians, allegedly contributing to playground bullying of dark-skinned children. The episode seems to have galvanised members of the Nubian community, who originate from southern Egypt and north Sudan, the descendants of the founders of the Nubian kingdom, one of Africa&apos;s earliest black civilisations, which flourished along the banks of the Nile some 3,000 years BC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The singer has apologised profusely for any offence caused and claimed that the song was penned by an Egyptian writer who told her that the term referred to a popular children&apos;s street game (which makes no sense in the context of the song, where the boy is ticking off a list of toys he wants including a teddy bear, Barbie and toy musical organ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is one of very few incidents I recall where racism against black Arabs has been addressed or discussed in the media and public arena apart from flash points over the treatment of foreign Arab black refugees. In an infamous incident in 2005, more than 20 Sudanese refugees died after heavy-handed treatment by Egyptian authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Egypt&apos;s Nubian minority are largely absent from popular culture and the upper echelons of politics and business, some dark-skinned figures such as Mohamed Mounir and the late Ahmad Zaki achieved iconic status. Residual attitudes still remain, though. It always annoyed me that Zaki was often referred to as &quot;the asmar (loosely translated as dark or dusky) artist&quot;. That struck me as casual racism in the guise of fetishised endearment, similar to the way black girls are treated in the streets of Cairo when apparently being complimented on their dark complexions (being referred to as &quot;Kit Kat&quot; just isn&apos;t cute). Perceptions are so entrenched that they are not seen as offensive and find their way into pop media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that a surgically enhanced fair-skinned Lebanese singer is at the centre of this controversy is perhaps not just bad luck. Lebanese standards of beauty and complexion have taken the Arab world by storm  since the resurgence of the Lebanese in media after the end of the Lebanese civil war, further limiting the accepted definition of beauty as light-skinned, catty-eyed and slim-nosed. Fair &amp;amp; Lovely, a popular whitening cream, advertises itself on Arabic TV when a model is rejected for being too dark, only to be ecstatically accepted after a few weeks of applying the magic cream. As Wehbe is the very epitome and embodiment of this standard, the lyric is that much more patronising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The absence of a culture of political correctness in a society that generally promotes very limited and monolithic ideals of identity means that minority rights suffer, and that most would dismiss the complaint as an overreaction to a mindless children&apos;s tune sung by an equally vacant performer. But it is not only through obvious flare-ups and incidents that discrimination is perpetuated – it is also also through the everyday normalisation of racist address and the apathy this breeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nubians want a formal apology and an end to airing the song in Egypt. Perhaps this will call attention to an endemic culture of racial stereotyping in the region and raise the standards of reference to darker-skinned Arabs in Egypt and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is comment. GNM does not necessarily support the views expressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355961422|2009-11-25T21:07:12|db90434325cb89f45404f4b4ef1f6363d18c9cd7 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Miriam Makeba was Africa&apos;s first and greatest international superstar, a diva as well known for her dramatic life and political role as for her thrilling, versatile voice. Of course, she deserved a tribute concert, but it was often difficult for this cast to match Makeba&apos;s recordings. And, although Makeba spent many years in exile in Guinea, it was curious that the show was dominated by west African rather than South African artists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presenter was Angélique Kidjo, from Benin, a long-time friend of Makeba, who started with one of her best-known songs from the 1960s, Mbube. It was an energetic, sturdy performance, helped by fine harmonies from Makeba&apos;s own backing trio, but was no match for the exhilarating, soulful original. Then came Sayon Bamba and Dobet Gnahoré, two impressive young singers who succeeded best with their duet on another 60s favourite, Kilimanjaro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originality, not imitation, was urgently required, and the finest performance of the evening came from the one South African male star in the lineup, the soulful Vusi Mahlasela. He followed a duet with Kidjo with a glorious, rolling treatment of Makeba&apos;s hit, The Click Song. Then came a burst of desert blues guitar from Vieux Farka Touré, a rousing revival of Khawuleza from Senegal&apos;s Baaba Maal, a dodgy treatment of Malaika featuring Kidjo, Maal and Nigerian singer Asa, and an unnecessary reminder from Asa that Makeba also recorded such forgettable pop songs as I Shall Sing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end, Kidjo was storming through the crowd singing her own tribute anthem Afrika, before leading the cast through the ever-glorious Pata Pata. It was an enjoyable, if patchy set; more great South African musicians, like Hugh Masekela or Thandiswa, would have helped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355970542|2009-11-25T21:07:12|dc8113fdcfddae24cf2139436e5e0bb9622125e3 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;When the U2 manager, Paul McGuinness, called the Glastonbury founder, Michael Eavis, last week, he did not have to use many words. &quot;Michael, it is the call you have been waiting for ... &quot; was more than sufficient to let Eavis know that his 26-year quest to get the band to headline the festival was finally over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glastonbury organisers confirmed today that U2 will play the Pyramid stage&apos;s top spot on Friday 25 June next year. It will be the band&apos;s first appearance at Glastonbury, and one of their few on the global festival scene since they hit the pinnacle of their fame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eavis had promised something special for Glastonbury&apos;s 40th anniversary, and in booking a band who have been rumoured to headline every year since the mid-1980s, he has not disappointed. The ebullient 74-year-old said the news had been a long time coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The 26-year-old rumour has finally come true. At last, the biggest band in the world are going to play the best festival in the world,&quot; he said. &quot;Nothing could be better for our 40th anniversary party.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U2 will take a fleeting break from their north American tour to fly over to Somerset, McGuinness said. &quot;The band has always wanted to do Glastonbury one day. This year everyone was in the right mood.&quot; Bono sparked a flurry of speculation when he said on BBC radio in February that playing the festival was &quot;something we&apos;re working up our whole life to do&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some expressed doubts that U2 and Glastonbury were a perfect match. Their performance had the potential to be slightly &quot;weird&quot;, said Nicola Slade, editor of the music industry newsletter Record of the Day. &quot;They are not going to be able to do their usual U2 spectacular that people have come to expect from them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The band was accustomed to playing to dedicated fans, not to a more mixed festival crowd, Slade said. &quot;U2 are a divisive band – you either love them or you hate them. I think it will be a difficult audience because it is not their core contingent.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U2&apos;s propensity to play large-scale spectacular gigs was one of the reasons they had not yet played the festival, McGuinness said. &quot;I think they have stayed clear of them because they tend to do a big, monster product which doesn&apos;t necessarily fit into a festival context.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The band, who will play no other UK gig next year, may opt for a slightly more low-fi affair more in keeping with the Glastonbury vibe and will not bring the 360° tour to Worthy Farm, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans of the group can expect a mixture of old and new hits, McGuinness said. The band were excited about playing at such an &quot;English institution&quot;, he added. &quot;It&apos;s like Wimbledon or the Cup Final.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tickets for next year&apos;s Glastonbury sold out in 24 hours without a sniff of a confirmed headliner. The Guardian is the official media sponsor of the festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355969325|2009-11-25T21:07:12|aa778c3e1337d87ce41b3d83a53ae012eb30da16 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Eighteen years after the death of Miles Davis, the dark prince of jazz still casts a long shadow. Yet, everyone can take something from his legacy and make it theirs. Bonnie Greer&apos;s contribution to the London jazz festival, at the Purcell Room on Sunday, was a mixture of spoken word and music inspired by  Davis&apos;s brief affair with singer Juliette Gréco. Greer&apos;s readings from Davis&apos;s autobiography alternated with Cleveland Watkiss&apos;s sensitive vocal improvisations, but I yearned to hear more of Greer&apos;s opinions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Barbican the previous day, there was a more evolved mix of words and music, when Roy Nathanson performed his freewheeling meditations on life, the universe and underground transport, recently published in his book Subway Moon. His band, Soto Voce, took its drive from the extraordinary beatboxing of Napoleon Maddox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The festival&apos;s closing gig was Marcus Miller&apos;s Tutu Revisited, based on Davis&apos;s 1986 album Tutu, which was largely composed and produced by Miller. What we got on Sunday at the Barbican was a hybrid: at times, it was a Miller gig, feel-good, funky and bass-dominated; at other moments, we got the original album&apos;s combustible mix of electro-funk and introspection. A critic once called Tutu &quot;the perfect accompaniment to the shame and splendour of our cities&quot;, and tunes such as Tomaas, Splatch and Full Nelson still have a vivid power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keyboardist Federico Gonzalez Peña wrangled some authentic 1980s synth noises, while 26-year-old Christian Scott played the trumpet parts undaunted. Miller threw in (non-Tutu) favourites such as Jean-Pierre and Human Nature, before doing a slow version of the album&apos;s title track. But the revelation was saxophonist Alex Han. Not born when Tutu was released, he was distinctive on soprano and thrilling  on alto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355970312|2009-11-25T21:07:12|afaa14934b062a1eb01fa9cf4e6721389a0e58d6 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Can you see the girls?&quot; asks Stuart Murdoch, gesturing to the three doe-eyed beauties fluttering on stage. He is worried that we&apos;re not getting our money&apos;s worth. &quot;Is that sexist? What&apos;s wrong with being sexy?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there&apos;s one thing Murdoch&apos;s main band, Belle &amp;amp; Sebastian, have never been accused of being, it&apos;s sexy. Yet unrequited, desperate lust pulses beneath most Murdoch songs, and it rampages through this side-project. Inspired by 1960s girl groups and nouvelle vague cinema, God Help the Girl exist as a band only to perform the soundtrack to a movie Murdoch plans to film next year. Its songs trace the story of Eve, a young woman recovering from a nervous breakdown, although that narrative is effaced when the band – members of Belle &amp;amp; Sebastian and a trio of singers Murdoch found through ad-hoc auditions – perform live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aesthetic is typically Murdoch, with multi-layered melodies cascading around slightly prolix lyrics, and thrillingly reminiscent of Phil Spector pop, especially in Musician, Please Take Heed and God Help the Girl, when the singers dance to illustrate the chorus. Catherine Ireton&apos;s lead vocals are wonderfully pure and filthily sensual, and – although Alex Klobouk&apos;s voice is too thin to carry the squelchily sentimental Stills, and Celia Garcia reduces Baby&apos;s Just Waiting to cheesy dinner jazz – their backing harmonies are exquisite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listening to Belle &amp;amp; Sebastian, one always felt short-changed when Murdoch didn&apos;t sing; here he takes the mic for just one song, Perfection As a Hipster, and his fears of sounding like Mike Yarwood prove not unfounded. Even so, when that marks the end of a 50-minute set, it&apos;s hard not to wish for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355969300|2009-11-25T21:07:12|7996e89c64af6e83544b8c53b7a6a0652c57b95c --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;The newspaper obituaries of opera singers, which are invariably written by anorak-coated music critics, too often take a standard and not very interesting form. Born. Studied with. Made debut as. First appeared in this country as. Much admired in the roles of X, Y and Z. Triumphed as this or that. Retired early ― or late. Much loved. Now dead. Usually accompanied by a nice photo in costume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just occasionally, however, a singer is too interesting and too rounded ahuman being to be confined within that dull mould. There was an example of that last week in the obituaries of the remarkable Armenian- Greek soprano Arda Mandikian, who I confess was barely a name to me but whose life and art would clearly be worth a full biography. Now, all too rapidly after the death of a great southern European soprano, comes the death of a great northern European one, and one who, like Mandikian, can simply not be adequately recalled within the list of the roles that she sang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Söderström was not so much a great soprano – though she was one ― as a great actor and a remarkable woman. I can tell you when I heard her first ― at Covent Garden as the Countess in The Marriage of Figaro. And I can tell you when I heard her last ― the New York Met 10 years ago in her farewell performances as a very different Countess, in Tchaikovsky&apos;s The Queen of Spades. I can tell you some of the roles I heard her sing, too ― Mélisande, Madeleine and Katya Kabanova among them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The feeling that touched an audience in a Söderström performance, though, was not the response to the voice, lovely though that was. It was the response to the person. Söderström possessed a remarkable ability to communicate the personality of the character she was portraying by drawing on things within her own personality. I do not in the slightest degree mean that she always played herself ― as Pavarotti did or Bartoli does. She could not have been more different when she portrayed Katya or Madeleine. What you always got from her was intelligence and empathy. You cared about her character because you cared about Söderström. Everything she did was always interesting. You could, I suppose, say that she was a superb actor, which she was, but that would not capture the presence and humanity that she always conveyed. She was a giver to an audience, all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was once told a story about Söderström that may help to convey how her artistry burned. She was rehearsing the Countess Madeleine at Glyndebourne under John Pritchard. The contract with the orchestra meant that Pritchard had to stop the rehearsal on the dot, or else the musicians would start qualifying for overtime, which could not be afforded. The rehearsal went slowly, and had only reached part way through the magical closing scene for the soprano when the deadline was reached. In the pit, Pritchard promptly put down his baton. The orchestra stopped and began packing up. Söderström, in full flow and unprepared for the break, looked as if she had been physically struck down by the sudden end of the rehearsal. In tears, she refused to stop, and sang her part unaccompanied to the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was such a nice woman too. I only met her once, at the court theatre at Drottningholm outside Stockholm where she was artistic director for a few years in the mid-1990s. &quot;Hello,&quot; she said as I arrived for my appointment, &quot;I have been so looking forward to this. Let&apos;s go and have some lunch and you can tell me about English politics.&quot; She laughed a lot. She told great stories. She was a great talker. Meeting her was like meeting a favourite relative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many years ago Söderström appeared on Desert Island Discs. Unlike some sopranos, who choose only records by other sopranos and sometimes only records they have made themnselves, I remember that Söderström chose a wonderfully eclectic selection. One of her choices was a really grungey heavy metal track ― I can&apos;t remember who it was by. Why did you choose that, she was asked? Because my son likes playing it all the time, very loudly, and it will remind me of him, she replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With some singers, what matters is the voice. With others, it&apos;s the stage presence. Söderström had both the voice and the presence. But she had something even more special, her life-enhancing personality and warmth which infused every aspect of her artistry. Many singers attract admiration. A few attract worship. Söderström, on the other hand, attracted love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355955971|2009-11-25T21:07:12|bc3b88e94317e182549d209e8f7ee277725885ac --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hometown: Norbury, London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lineup: Rox (vocals).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The background: We keep thinking we&apos;ve heard all the major female contenders for 2010, but as Todd Rundgren once sang, &quot;There&apos;s always more&quot;. And they all seem poised to succeed. Trouble is, Ellie Goulding in the UK and Sky Ferreira in the States, the two female performers most likely to next year, are operating in quite different areas, whereas Rox, Rough Trade&apos;s latest signing and a 22-year-old from south London, has staked a claim to the densely populated pop-soul terrain already occupied by newbie Clare Maguire as well as the original retro-soul girls Amy, Adele and Duffy. It&apos;s actually not a million miles away, either, from the showier Paloma Faith while her chirrupy delivery reminds us of the girl group/indie-soul stylings of Remi Nicole whose recent second album didn&apos;t even see a release. But she does what she does – sing and write perky pop-soul tunes – pretty well. Whether or not she does it sufficiently differently is another matter, so unless the Big Three radically change direction (and rumour has it that Adele is working with someone quite unexpected on her second album) Rox is going to have tough competition with her 2010 debut album, from both within and outside Rough Trade, who also happen to manage Duffy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The half-Persian/half-Jamaican singer-songwriter is a priority for Rough Trade, though, and they&apos;ve been working hard to build a reputation for her. Rox has already performed at this year&apos;s Reading festival (with Wiley) and the BBC&apos;s Electric Proms (with Nitin Sawhney) and her finger-snapping single I Don&apos;t Believe has been used to soundtrack a Rimmel TV ad. She also stood in for Amy Winehouse, singing Valerie at a Mark Ronson show, and she performed two tracks on Later With Jools Holland last week (we remember VV Brown was on similarly early in her career – hmm …). She describes her songs as &quot;like the written pages in my diary – personal, honest, and all the subjects and words are real&quot;. The biggest influence on her lyrics is &quot;love, tragedy and all that other good stuff that makes art enjoyable&quot;, while musically she draws on gospel, country and R&amp;amp;B, and artists as varied as Alanis Morissette (&quot;for the teenage angst&quot;) to Eva Cassidy (&quot;she kept me in touch with my emotional side&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the tracks we&apos;ve heard, I Don&apos;t Believe and My Baby Left Me are the most instantly infectious and squarely in the 60s soul pastiche camp, while Rocksteady is as the title suggests a Lovers Rock homage (delivered straighter than that other new girl, Coco Sumner, does reggae). Her new single No Going Back is gospel-tinged Motown-esque soul-pop. Vocally, although mightily efficient, she&apos;s not as extraordinary as some. We mean that both ways – she hasn&apos;t quite found her &quot;voice&quot; yet. She could have written her songs for any number of female singers. Then again, she could be a bit of a Corinne Bailey Rae, who seemed lightweight at the start but whose second album is currently being hailed as a masterpiece. Rox may not have anything truly original to say right now, and she may not do so for some time, but she would appear to be an artist who is perhaps worth sticking with over the distance. Meanwhile, we&apos;d suggest pushing her in the direction of a UK Erykah Badu ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The buzz: &quot;Stunningly soulful.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth: We wouldn&apos;t wish Corinne Bailey Rae&apos;s annus horribilis on anyone, but we can&apos;t help thinking Rox will need to live a little before she produces anything truly great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most likely to: Marry Andre 3000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Least likely to: Use L&apos;Oreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to buy: No Going Back is released by Rough Trade on 7 December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;File next to: Adele, Amy, Corinne Bailey Rae, Paloma Faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links: myspace.com/roxmusik&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow&apos;s new band: Alex Gardner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355964207|2009-11-25T21:07:12|1e520ab2524e1c4a7c83c74d197966b99a833503 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;In an era when musicians revealed their private lives to the public via MySpace and Twitter, when even the biggest stars were stripped of enigma by the paparazzi or in the pages of Heat, the idea of anonymity suddenly seemed powerful, if you knew how to use it. So when electronic music prodigy Burial released his self-titled debut album in 2006, declining even to identify himself, let alone submit to photographs and interviews, it certainly lent his soulful take on the era&apos;s key sub-genre – dubstep – extra mystique. By the time its successor, 2007&apos;s Untrue, won a Mercury prize nomination, and Burial was being hyped as the next Aphex Twin – a whiz kid from the margins set to impact on the mainstream – the myth was powerful enough for one tabloid to start a campaign to name him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, Burial saved them the bother by quickly &quot;outing&quot; himself as William Bevan, a young south Londoner reared on 1990s drum&apos;n&apos;bass and garage. Untrue married the former&apos;s sense of scale with the latter&apos;s fleetness of foot, adding a sadness that was unique to Bevan. It was soaked in a particularly urban melancholy: the 3am blues of In McDonald&apos;s was instantly recognisable to anyone who&apos;s ever been stuck in a fast food outlet in the early hours with only a styrofoam cup of coffee for warmth. While other dubstep artists grew colder and more alienated, Bevan outstripped his peers by heading in the opposite direction, conjuring emotion from disembodied female vocal samples and old videogames. These were explicit links between rave&apos;s past and its thriving offspring in the present, who were still plugging away in the underground, occasionally yielding up something truly special.Buy this Sunday&apos;s Observer for the full top 50 countdown, plus an interview with the winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355870081|2009-11-25T21:07:12|1b45169658bcab61b94aeef9823e4cfeef84c518 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Robbie Williams may soon replace record executives with stockbrokers, selling a 50% stake in album, tour and merchandise profits. The singer&apos;s management is reportedly preparing a plan that would see financial institutions invest £50m toward Williams&apos;s musical future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former Take That star will soon complete his four-album, £55m deal with EMI – and he sees no need to renew it. Instead, manager Tim Clark told the Times, Williams hopes to find investors who will trade cash upfront for profits later, reaping the rewards of the 35-year-old&apos;s recently revivified career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan is for an &quot;all-rights deal&quot;, in which all of Williams&apos;s profits, from ringtones to concerts and baseball caps, would be channelled into one company – and then split among investors. EMI allegedly profited on its £55m investment, so why not a bank, hedge fund or Russian oil billionaire? The deal may even include proceeds from a Take That reunion with Williams: &quot;They are all getting on extremely well and I&apos;m sure something would come out of it,&quot; Clark said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems that everything a record label does, a group of investors can do better. &quot;You can just buy the services you need, whether it is CD distribution or marketing,&quot; Clark said. Fourteen years into his solo career, with 48m albums sold, Williams doesn&apos;t need the same sort of help that many younger artists do. Indeed, major acts, from David Bowie to Public Enemy, have tried similar things – with varying degrees of success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Clark approaches potential investors, the main question will be about Williams&apos;s own potential. The record industry is not, after all, at its peak. Though Williams&apos;s new album, Reality Killed the Video Star, debuted at No 2, it was the first Williams album to miss the top spot – and its first-week sales were less than two-thirds of those for his last LP, 2005&apos;s Intensive Care. (They were, however, an improvement on sales from 2006&apos;s Rudebox.) While previous Williams albums have sold about seven million copies worldwide, his manager said, &quot;the internet means that the days when you could get that kind of figure are gone&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Clark admitted that Williams may yet sign a conventional record deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355946197|2009-11-25T21:07:12|db10c9e6804d3254c033e2b69e5d87de2dffa704 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;For a non-pianist, the idea of a microtonally fluid piano might seem either no big deal or baffling. But this weekend a composer will reveal the result of a  10-year mission – nothing less than the reinvention of one of the most important instruments in western music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geoff Smith believes he has come up with the first multicultural acoustic piano – what he has trademarked as a fluid piano – which allows players to alter the tuning of notes either before or during a performance. Instead of a pianist having a fixed sound, 88 notes from 88 keys, Smith&apos;s piano has sliders allowing them access to the different scales that you get in, for example, Indian and Iranian music. For good measure, Smith has included a horizontal harp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guardian was last weekend given the first access to an instrument that is already generating considerable excitement – and it can be seen and heard on our website. It will be formally unveiled at the University of Surrey on Saturday and receive a London premiere at the Purcell Room in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith, a Brighton-based composer and performer, said: &quot;The fluid piano is a western piano as we know it, similar to an early fortepiano, but because of the tuning mechanisms, suddenly, musicians can explore scales from the Middle East, from Iran.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith&apos;s instrument has been made by the Somerset-based Christopher Barlow and a light ash has been deliberately chosen as the wood – Smith said he did not want it to look like a dark coffin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fluid piano has generated much interest since it was first mentioned in the Guardian six years ago – when it was Smith with little more than a one-key mechanism and an ambition. Now he has the actual instrument he has been getting performers on board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;ve said to musicians they might feel insecure about this piano, they might feel scared. But if they embrace it they will have this big feeling of liberation, a big high.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the premiere, three pianists will perform, including Pam Chowhan, the head of planning at the Royal Festival Hall. She admitted to being daunted when first confronted with the piano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It was really scary, it is even now. I&apos;m mainly a classical pianist and you kind of know what you&apos;re doing, you know how the piano is going to respond and you spend ages and ages on tone control andknowinghow it is going to sound. Suddenly I&apos;ve got a piano which sounds like nothing I&apos;ve heard before. It opens up so many choices that you become almost paralysed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been all sorts of challenges, including having to come up with her own way of writing music for the instrument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chowhan said the internet had helped open access to all sorts of music from around the world. &quot;If you&apos;re going to start delving into different cultures and bring those influences into your work you need to think about tuning and the traditional piano simply can&apos;t cut it. The piano, for me, is absolutely useless in a non-western context because it can&apos;t respond to the subtle and fluid tuning of other cultures.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also performing on Saturday will be London-based jazz pianist Nikki Yeoh and the Leeds-based improvisational pianist Matthew Bourne. He said playing the fluid piano was &quot;like walking into a huge sweet shop. The possibilities are endless. Sometimes I do nothing, I just sit and stare at it&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith said he had received much support – from Arts Council England for example– but had also encountered resistance. &quot;Instruments of the western orchestra are locked in time, ringfenced. Why is that? It&apos;s not for technical reasons, so it must be for political or cultural reasons. There&apos;s a lot of talk in classical music about making orchestras more diverse. The only way you&apos;re going to bring new people in is by changing the instruments. To some people that is a completely alien concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are one of the most multicultural societies in Europe. Some people need to put their money where their mouth is.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith, who has written scores for silent films and is a highly regarded player of the hammered dulcimer,  has been invited to take his piano to a Chopin festival in Poland. But the dream is to get his fluid piano manufactured. &quot;It has become a fundamental part of my life, because it&apos;s driven by a vision. It&apos;s not just about money, although I haven&apos;t got much money so of course I&apos;d like to make some. Any money I have had has gone on this,&quot; he said.  &quot;The thing was, I always knew it would work – I wasn&apos;t like some crazy inventor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355928910|2009-11-25T21:07:12|30e1c8294fdffcf543ad0ceb9bd4599afa269f6a --&gt;</body>

Lloyd Carr&apos;s fault! Here is a video of one of the more interesting trick plays you&apos;ll ever see, from a Nov. 14 game between two small colleges. The no-look pass. And yes, this is football, not basketball. Apropos the headline, you are aware by now I assume that Bob Dylan is releasing a Christmas album. I haven&apos;t been able to bring myself to listen to any of the released track snippets. Please don&apos;t tell me. As one of you pointed out last re my Fox News doctored-footage video, I misspoke when discussing which events Fox had fibbed about. I said the 9-12 tea party march and a recent Palin book-tour event. It was actually the Michelle Bachmann Capitol Hill event and a Palin book-tour stop. Sorry about that. As for our joke footage, we were originally hoping to use footage of girls screaming at the Beatles, which I think would have been pretty hilarious. But we weren&apos;t allowed. The redoubtable Glenn, our video man, did quite nicely under the circumstances with the &quot;soccer&quot; footage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355957935|2009-11-25T21:07:12|9922453cff2394394895feb0338dd7ca90678893 --&gt;</body>

Because she&apos;s been awarded the highest honour available to a pop singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Victoria Cross? No, you dolt, a slot&amp;nbsp;at the Royal Variety Performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her Maj is a big fan, then? There has been no public statement from Buckingham Palace, though we suggest&amp;nbsp;Prince Philip neck some beta-blockers before the show. Goodness only knows what she will do&amp;nbsp;for his blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign is she? Italian-American, but it&apos;s her racy stage act we&apos;re worried about. The Daily Telegraph reported that at the MTV video awards she pretended to stab herself to death. Fake blood sprayed everywhere, and she ended up hanging from the ceiling. She&apos;s outrageous, you know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can&apos;t see how that would worry Prince Philip. Sounds suspiciously like the aftermath of a trip to the grouse moor, with her as the grouse. All right then, if you still don&apos;t believe she&apos;s a threat to the very fabric of society, you should read the Daily Mail. It reported that she&apos;s become a bad influence on&amp;nbsp;Beyoncé.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How? By convincing her to record fewer great pop songs and more tedious ballads? No, by getting her to wear an eye mask and a Perspex bra in&amp;nbsp;a video. Lady Gaga likes her peculiar&amp;nbsp;costumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, for goodness sake. Is that the best you can do? Listen, google Lady+Gaga+Outrage and you get 190,000 hits. Google Prince+Philip+Outrage and you only get 40,900 hits. Given the number of outrages he&apos;s been involved in, I&apos;d&amp;nbsp;say&amp;nbsp;that&apos;s pretty clear evidence of&amp;nbsp;her outrageousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do say: &quot;I used to buy my lingerie from La Perla, but I find Perspex so much more comfortable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&apos;t say: &quot;I&apos;m sure Prince Harry will&amp;nbsp;lend you one of his costumes for the show.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355872247|2009-11-25T21:07:12|ff2ab1df63615bb511db00610950d43390107465 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Seven years after being crowned winner of Britain&apos;s first Pop Idol television show, Will Young is celebrating the release of a greatest hits album, starting with two shows five minutes from his front door. But his thoughts are elsewhere. &quot;I was watching X Factor before this,&quot; he says, tantalising the crowd. &quot;Some major things have gone on.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having helped The X Factor&apos;s Cheryl Cole with her share of wannabes, Young&apos;s keen to talk shop, canvassing opinion on the contestants and showing off his Stacey Solomon impression. &quot;All in niceness, not nastiness,&quot; he adds hastily. &quot;You have to cover your back these days – in case I want to get on  the show.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following four successful studio albums and 10 Brit award nominations, Young&apos;s first single from The Hits, Hopes &amp;amp; Fears, failed to trouble the top 50. Still, every move he makes tonight elicits squeals of delight from mums and daughters, along with matey cheers of &quot;C&apos;mon Will!&quot; from men. Young is what Robbie Williams once was: the pop star next door, chatty, funny and sincere. Between slices of soulful pop and lovelorn ballads, he talks to the  crowd as if gossiping to friends, not  just admitting that he dances in front  of &quot;reflective surfaces&quot; at home, but giving a demonstration. Accepting a bouquet from the front row, Young  trills a melody, mixing Barbra Streisand&apos;s You Don&apos;t Bring Me Flowers with the West Ham anthem I&apos;m Forever Blowing Bubbles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&apos;s chummy with his five-piece band and two female backing singers, singing to the latter and aping their moves. But while the girls wear what look like sequin and feather embellished bin liners, Young is dapper in a fitted shirt and black bow tie for the sleek Switch It On and classy Your Game, before donning a velvet smoking jacket for some loungey covers. Accompanied  by a piano, he finds tenderness in  Buzzcocks&apos; Ever Fallen in Love, although his versions of Tears for  Fears&apos; Everybody Wants to Rule the World and the Box Tops&apos; The Letter  stir unnecessary memories of his  talent show past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With classics like Leave Right Now, Who Am I and Grace, Young proves he has moved beyond such karaoke. During the encore Evergreen, the crowd finally stop checking their phones for news of Jedward and seize the chance to sing along with a genuine talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Colston Hall, Bristol (0117-922 3686), tonight. Then touring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355956623|2009-11-25T21:07:12|e1ae84efec27b50b707eb653d13bf1d5fe348a82 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;U2 will headline next year&apos;s Glastonbury festival, it was confirmed today. Bono and co have been slated for the Pyramid stage&apos;s top spot on Friday 25 June, in what will be their first ever appearance at the festival. Organiser Michael Eavis had promised something special for Glastonbury&apos;s 40th anniversary, and in booking a band who have been rumoured to headline every year since the mid 1980s, he&apos;s done just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The 26-year-old rumour has finally come true,&quot; Eavis said. &quot;At last, the biggest band in the world are going to play the best festival in the world! Nothing could be better for our 40th anniversary party. And there are even more surprises in the pipeline.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eavis added: &quot;We&apos;ve been trying for years ... and now we&apos;ve finally made it happen. I&apos;m sure they will pull out all the stops to make next year&apos;s Glastonbury the most memorable ever.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U2 will fly to the UK to play the Somerset festival in the middle of their North American tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Bono told BBC Radio 1 that U2 had not been confirmed to play the festival in 2010, but was sure they would play Glastonbury at some point. &quot;I know lots of people who love music want us to. It&apos;s something we&apos;re working up our whole life to do.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tickets for next year&apos;s Glastonbury sold out in October after organisers  decided to release them early – a scheme that proved successful last year. The festival will take place between Friday 25 and Sunday 27 June 2010. So far, no other headliners have been confirmed. The Guardian is the official media sponsor of Glastonbury festival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355948392|2009-11-25T21:07:12|f594b4eaa8000a65d51e02f42917b5eb76136ad9 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;By normal industry standards, waiting until you&apos;re 53 to make the best album of your career is perhaps leaving it a bit late. But then not much about Salif Keita&apos;s story is normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was it a blessing or a curse for this Malian teenager – already singled out for being albino, and of royal descent – to find that he had one of the most remarkable voices anybody in the neighbourhood had ever heard? On the one hand, it set him apart and ahead of the competition to be invited to sing with two leading west African bands during the 1970s. On the other, it led to expectations that perhaps Keita could be something more than the most famous singer in west Africa – what about conquering the rest of the world? In 1987, the album Soro, expensively and elaborately produced in Paris, announced Keita&apos;s arrival in the English-speaking world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the following 15 years, it was almost as if he wilfully defied the hopes and expectations of those who had supported him, insisting on electric guitarists and synthesiser players in his recordings and for his live shows, despite entreaties that his music should sound less like Phil Collins and Peter Gabriel and more Malian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, astonishingly, in 2002 Keita relented and delivered the album Moffou, which was exactly what his fans had been praying for. First impressions were that this change of tack was mostly acoustic, but there are many subtle interventions of electric guitar and electronic effects. Moffou might feel like a natural, spontaneous recording, but clearly a lot of thought went in at every stage, from songwriting to arrangements and post-production – and, of course, the singing. If the plan was to deliver a classic album, it succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Keita&apos;s distinctive qualities as a songwriter is to set his own voice against female vocalists, and virtually every track here showcases this skill, starting with Yamore, a duet with the Cape Verdean singer Cesária Évora. The combination of the two voices seemed counterintuitive, with Keita being typically extravagant and Évora being laidback. But it works brilliantly, and behind them both, those gorgeous backing vocals answer and comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two other tracks stand out as the high points of a consistently lovely record. On Moussolou, Keita&apos;s tribute to women, his gentle vocal is carried along by  rippling guitars and percussion. On the haunting Baba, a traditional instrument plays an echoing melody in the background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moffou signalled what was to become a hugely successful 10 years for Malian music – in fact, the decade would end with a raft of pop and indie acts looking to the country for inspiration. West Africa provided several outstanding albums during the noughties, but most musicians would surely salute Keita&apos;s album as the pinnacle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buy this Sunday&apos;s Observer for the full top 50 countdown, plus an interview with the winner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355958602|2009-11-25T21:07:12|7146507a18ed5437ecf52a79b4313966a344d5c5 --&gt;</body>

      <type-specific class="article">
        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;What was I thinking? After two and a half years of striving to inspire a heated debate with an outmoded combination of impassioned polemic and old-school Bernstein and Woodward-style investigative journalism, last month&apos;s bulging crop of enraged responses confirmed that all you need to do to really get the wires humming is casually drop in a dismissive aside about Interpol or Spoon. But how best to pass the time until next month&apos;s no-stone-unturned analysis of the terrifying possibility that neither Broken Social Scene nor the Bowerbirds are currently among the world&apos;s top 10 rock bands? A spot-check on the current state of Anglo-American urban music magazine publishing seems the only realistic way forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the middle-shelf of a small newsagents in Hackney&apos;s once bustling Dalston Lane, there lurks what seems to be the entire UK stock of a publication called Hip Hop Weekly. This disturbingly entertaining magazine views the triumphs and tribulations of all your favourite rap stars (and a few you&apos;ve never heard of) through the same filter of amoral obsequiousness that Hello! used to – and, for all I know, still does – apply to the social lives of minor European royals. Thus paparazzi shots of Yung Joc&apos;s birthday bash at Velvet Room in Atlanta (&quot;Shawty Lo never misses an industry event&quot;) nestle comfortably alongside &quot;Beach Bodies&quot; Eve and Beyoncé.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the proceedings are given a distinctly surreal edge by the way hip-hop&apos;s darker realities are addressed in precisely the same breathlessly admiring voice with which Hip Hop Weekly introduces this season&apos;s fashion must-haves – that $570 pair of Miu Miu glitter slingbacks, for example, or the Stella McCartney patent rivet detail clutch (a snip at $725). One page it&apos;s &quot;Shady Dudes: Drake and Trey Songz rock their sunglasses&quot;, the next it&apos;s &quot;DG Yola begins jail sentence for shooting cousin&quot; or &quot;C-Murder Sentenced to Life&quot; (&quot;When his retrial began,&quot; asks the concerned interviewer, &quot;was he optimistic that he would be vindicated?&quot;). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strangest thing about such glaring disjunctions is that they are actually totally appropriate to the mixed messages encoded within rap&apos;s unfolding spectacle. And for anyone with even the slightest interest in finding out how Joe Budden&apos;s latest internet beef ended in real-life drama, Hip Hop Weekly is as essential as reading is likely to get (those not within striking distance of Dalston Lane can click here for a free sample)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Source, on the other hand – even &quot;under new management&quot;, as it is – seems to be struggling to come up with a consistent approach to rap&apos;s inner conflicts. A heartfelt editorial tries to convince us that &quot;it kind of feels like 1988 outside, like the days when hip-hop was about talking about something, when studied masters taught eager listeners how to get their hustle on&quot;. But such earnest hopes are quickly (albeit amusingly) undermined by &quot;Baby Mama Drama&quot;, a page-long celebration of the relative earning potentials of such former rap muses as TI&apos;s Lashonda Dixon and Jeezy&apos;s Tynesha Dykes: apparently &quot;sometimes it&apos;s cheaper to keep her&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following eye-catching standfirst suggests that the Source is currently happiest when it&apos;s worthiest: &quot;What happens when a rapper born in Peru and raised in New York City ventures into war-torn Afghanistan to start an orphanage? My name is Immortal Technique and this is my story, part two.&quot; But it&apos;s hard to have too much faith in a magazine that would allot four pages to an in-depth interview with Warner Music Group co-chairman Lyor Cohen, but only two to speak to the great Ghostface Killah (and one of those is taken up by an – admittedly excellent – photo of the Wu-Tang&apos;s finest wearing a highly desirable tangerine velour tracksuit).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happily, Kevin Fairbanks&apos;s regrettably brief encounter with the man who would be Tony Starks still manages to pack a punch. Having worried for years if his fans would accept the distinct R&amp;amp;B-ward move he&apos;s making on forthcoming album, The Wizard of Poetry, Ghostface explains that he has now reached a stage in his career &quot;where I&apos;ve been around so long that I don&apos;t give a fuck if my fans respect it or not. The ones that don&apos;t respect it – this ain&apos;t for you then. I&apos;ll catch y&apos;all … when I get back to talking that other stupid-ass shit&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Passing swiftly over a copy of XXL magazine with Jay-Z on the cover (editor Vanessa Satten has crawled so far up Hov&apos;s arse in her determination to secure the 24 pages of Rocawear adverts with which last month&apos;s issue opens that apparently you can still see the top of her head when he opens his mouth to speak), we find ourselves contemplating the place in the Borders magazine section where the specialist British black music titles used to be. Only a beleaguered-looking Echoes remains, and I&apos;m not sure if an interview with Reggae Reggae sauce mogul Levi Roots represents the best strategy for securing this distinguished title&apos;s long-term future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online, though, things look a little brighter, with a surprisingly functional version of old rival Blues and Soul (&quot;The official first stop for music writing, comment, integrity, opinion and listings,&quot; apparently) trumping Echoes&apos; lamentably inadequate Maxwell interview with Pete Lewis&apos;s vastly superior career retrospective. And best (albeit saddest) of all – the finest journalistic catch in this month&apos;s transatlantic trawl – are the handful of prototype digital editions put together by the late-lamented Hip-Hop Connection, which gave up the physical ghost earlier this year, but still struggles on virtually. Compact and elegant PDFs are easily downloadable (well, the T La Rock one was, I could only get the cover of the much sought after MF Doom exclusive). Read them and weep, or, if you are a millionaire rap star, slip them £50k to get this beautifully designed vehicle back on the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355802410|2009-11-25T21:07:12|3b64093855f61dcfc044c968488d44ad2a983bcf --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;A Canadian man has admitted shoving Noel Gallagher at an Oasis concert in Toronto in September 2008, claiming he was drunk at the time. Daniel Sullivan pleaded guilty to assault causing bodily harm but said he has no recollection of how he mounted the stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to attorney Ruth Neilson, Sullivan made his way on to the main stage at Toronto Island&apos;s Virgin Music festival, &quot;ran past the electrical cords ... past the drum kit and lunged toward Noel Gallagher, shoving him violently from behind with great force&quot;. The former Oasis guitarist fell on to a speaker, fracturing three ribs. &quot;Sullivan almost made it to Liam Gallagher, but was tackled by security and was taken to the ground,&quot; Neilson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noel Gallagher said that he felt &quot;winded&quot; after the attack, but  was fit enough to carry on – and Oasis completed the last 20 minutes of their concert. Though the band eventually cancelled five gigs, it wasn&apos;t until Gallagher went for a CT scan in London two weeks later that doctors discovered  he had fractured his ninth, tenth and eleventh ribs. It took eight months before the singer felt normal again, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It appears no one attempted to prevent Sullivan from gaining access to the stage until he was tackled by Oasis,&quot; Neilson said. The 48-year-old resident of Pickering, Ontario only &quot;remembers attempting to climb over the fence&quot;, but not the sequence of events that led to him assaulting one of the world&apos;s biggest rock stars. &quot;He was held backstage for police,&quot; Neilson said. &quot;Police reported that Sullivan was resisting, struggling and screaming as he was arrested. Officers tried to calm him down.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Richard Schneider scheduled a sentencing for 5 February 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355943945|2009-11-25T21:07:12|490d1f6a60809e23ab1e1fff8346b6b73651ff7e --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;RAIN &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you go clubbing just once in Vegas, Rain is the place to head for. It&apos;s vast: 28,000 sq ft on three levels, with water fountains and spectacular pyrotechnics, including 14ft fireballs, and they regularly bring in guest DJs from Europe. If you&apos;re with a few friends or a group it&apos;s worth reserving a booth or a &quot;skybox&quot; – a private seating area for up to 15 people. Places come and go in Vegas, but after six years there still isn&apos;t a club to touch it. Just make sure you&apos;ve got a firm hold on your drink when the fireballs get going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• 00 1 702 942 7777; palms.com/nightlife_3.php&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JOE&apos;S&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you open a successful restaurant in LA, Miami or New York, a franchise always opens in Vegas, and Joe&apos;s is the sister of a seasonal restaurant in Miami that only opens for four months. It offers fabulous seafood and steaks, but its most famous dish is Florida stone crab. The crabs are farmed, but rather than kill them, Joe&apos;s removes one claw, and then releases the crab back into the sea, where the claw grows back. It sounds bizarre, but they are absolutely delicious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• 00 1 702 792 9222; joes.net/las-vegas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOVE ITALIANO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of Italian restaurants in Vegas but if you&apos;re after some less heavy, slightly less obvious Italian cuisine then Nove, in Palms Fantasy Tower, is a great bet. It feels slightly decadent, all decked out in chocolate and gold, but the menu is really light, with beautiful fresh fish. I tend to go for the steaks – they&apos;re perfectly cooked with a good range of sauces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• 00 1 702 942 6800; n9negroup.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOVE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a hundred and one shows in Vegas, but for me the best right now is Love. A Cirque du Soleil show based around the Beatles, it&apos;s an incredible mix of visuals, music and amazing acrobatics against a backdrop of the Fab Four. They really take circus production to another level – and best of all they&apos;ve got the rights to the music, so it&apos;s all the original songs rather than cover versions. It&apos;s a great show and brings home how unique the Beatles were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• 00 1 702 792 7777; cirquedusoleil. com/love&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ARTISAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a crazy hotel, with paintings all over the ceilings and lots of exotic sculpture and leather sofas. It&apos;s off the Strip, which is a bonus in itself because this is where you get a sense of the old Vegas. There&apos;s a formal dining room with leopard-print chairs and a scarlet ceiling, or the picture-clad lounge area. Kick off a night with a drink here before exploring some of the old kitschy cocktail bars nearby that still have the ghosts of Sinatra and the Mob.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• 00 1 702 214 4000; theartisanhotel.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355800361|2009-11-25T21:07:12|b861ae57b76d8af98c2cef74af2747d653ec2ba8 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Something very strange happens, in the company of Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoli, to cynicism. After a while, even the blandest of statements has you  nodding away, enthralled – not that there are too many, but before we get on to the sociopathy of the conquistadores or the sex lives of nuns, there has to be, almost by default, some stuff about &quot;challenges&quot; and &quot;evolving&quot;. It&apos;s as if you heard a Miss World contestant blapping away about saving lost puppies and wishing for world peace and thought, simply, &quot;Oh, that&apos;s good then. The puppies are safe. And no more wars.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainly, the power comes from the fact that I am very soon thinking about far deeper things than one might expect, especially if one was coming to Shakira on the music and looks alone. Thinking, arguing, about aspects of pre-teen education, and realising that she not only knows what she&apos;s talking about, but puts her money where her mouth is. It suddenly strikes me that she&apos;s Madonna gone right. She&apos;s not arrogant or demanding, she can sing, can actually dance, writes her own music, does good things for children without always having to pick them up and &quot;take them home with her&quot;. Shakira doesn&apos;t just talk about it: she gets things done. In the past few years she has built five children&apos;s schools in her native Colombia. She sits through interminable meetings with squabbling Latin American politicians, trying to charm and nuance her way into firm commitments to education for 0 to 6-year-olds. Both Barack Obama and Gordon Brown have called her for advice, and they weren&apos;t cosmetic calls, and she&apos;s now busy talking to Warren Buffet&apos;s son, Howard, about future programmes. For perhaps the first time ever,  I find myself becoming interested in pop stars who do – well, this is honestly not &quot;charidee&quot;, it&apos;s the real thing. She is seen as something of a saint in her own country. There are statues to her. Writhing teens love her for putting Latin American dance-music around the world: nuns revere her for building schools for orphans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be wilfully disingenuous to deny, of course, that there are other reasons to like her. I mean… 4ft 11in tall (though nearer five six in tonight&apos;s heels), 32 years old, svelte and lithe and impossibly smiley and, oh, she&apos;s also unmarried and worth an estimated €26m… what&apos;s not to adore?  But it&apos;s not just me, by which I mean it&apos;s not just men. &quot;Bloody hell I love her,&quot; texts a female friend when hearing that I&apos;m meeting her. &quot;Even if she is a freak by having precisely double the number of vertebrae of &apos;normal&apos; women.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And how, you might wonder, as I did, did she reconcile her two worlds? The video for her latest single, &quot;She-Wolf&quot;, has Shakira licking the bars of cages, near naked. Her hips do quite impossible things, and, yes, her vertebrae do indeed go all the way down to her bottom. Gabriel Garcia Marquez has written, in a prescient essay on the star, of her &quot;innocent sensuality&quot;, and that seems a fair way of putting it: she exudes, in person, a gentler megagirl-next-door allure rather than rampant bar-clawing pheromones. But, still, the video – with 35m &quot;hits&quot; already on YouTube – is, it&apos;s quite fair to say, raunch personified. How does that go down in the convents of Barranquilla?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Not too long ago,&quot; she replies, starting to giggle, hiding her laughter with her hand, &quot;my mum ran into one nun at home, who&apos;d known me, and the nun told her, &apos;Oh my God, I watched the &quot;She-Wolf&quot; video, and Shakira looks phenomenal in it! I love how she looks, how she does the splits, and how flexible her legs are.&apos; This was an 80-year-old nun. Times are changing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are, indeed: but for her, now, surely they needn&apos;t, not too much. She really must have it all, and could put her tiny feet up, a little. Lives in the Bahamas, with her boyfriend of nine years, Antonio de la Rúa, son of the former Argentinian president, Fernando de la Rúa – they&apos;ve been engaged seemingly endlessly, enthralling the gossip-sheets of Latin America with perennial on/off speculation, but she recently said she didn&apos;t really want marriage, just permanent togetherness. She travels to global conferences on child development and early education: and when she goes back to Barranquilla, the Caribbean port town where she was born, she is accorded near-divine status, and this new album has already been critically acclaimed across the known and most of the unknown world. So why does she still do it, touring and the rest? Why are we sitting here, in the drab mazes of ITV&apos;s Bankside studios, after she&apos;s just done a full two hours on the Paul O&apos;Grady Show, being lusted after by, it would seem, both Jo Brand and David Walliams? &quot;That&apos;s a good question. Ha!&quot; My heart sinks, a little: flattering the interviewer is often a prelude to inanities. But, it turns out, she really does think it a good question – maybe she&apos;s just glad I haven&apos;t yet asked her about her fiancee, or her mad lyrics – and wants to think about the answer. She does this a lot, in our 40 minutes: lapses into complete concentrating silence, her brown eyes staring at the floor, hands clasped together before her, thinking, translating, trying to answer honestly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I wonder why. People get jaded in every profession, but for some reason I feel as passionate as when I was 13 years old and just released my first album, I feel the same amount of adrenalin in my blood, and the same amount of curiosity as well. Curiosity about why I&apos;m different.&quot; Which was going to be my next question anyway: what made her dig out this phenomenal career for herself, and then stick at it, and then plough the huge riches back into her home town: what made her special?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah. Hmm. I guess it has a lot to do with me wanting to make my mum happy and my dad proud. It became a  compulsion at about the age of eight. My dad had a financial crisis. He went through bankruptcy. And there&apos;s a story,  I think I&apos;ve said it before, but it&apos;s still true, about him taking me to the park.&quot; Her father William, a Lebanese-born jeweller with eight children from his first marriage – Shakira (which means &quot;thankful&quot; in Arabic) is the only child of his second wife Nidya – lost his business in 1985. He sent Shakira and her mother to live in Los Angeles while he sorted out his affairs, and on their return the youngster was shocked at the changes to what had been a pleasant middle-class life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Looking back now, it sounds like such a small event, but you have to remember – I was seven, eight at the time. And came back to find no furniture. No car. We never had a car from then on, until I could buy one. The TV was now a tiny one, black and white.&quot; Her father took her to a local park to show her that, though circumstances had changed, she wasn&apos;t the poorest child in Barranquilla. &quot;And there were all the kids sniffing glue, barefoot, just trying to survive. My parents wanted to show me a different reality, give me some perspective. When this happened, it left a mark in my impressionable mind forever – it was a turning point. After that visit to the park I made myself a promise to succeed in life. To vindicate my parents, yes. But also to do something for those kids who were orphans. If I ever succeeded, accomplished my goals in life, I wanted to somehow change their life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had already begun trying to be creative – her father had bought her a typewriter before she was five, on which she wrote early poetry, and even after the bankruptcy he &quot;went through hoops&quot;, she now says, to continue a half-decent education, begging the nuns at the Colegio La Ensenañza to take her back. She was soon singing and belly-dancing all around the area, winning a little contest here, a little one there, even though her music teacher said her vibrato was too strong and that she sounded &quot;like a goat&quot;: and by her mid-teens, through a supportive contact, met Sony Colombia executive Ciro Vargas and given him an impromptu audition in a hotel lobby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was signed for three albums, and recorded Magia when only 13, then the second in 1993. Both were fairly successful, particularly in her local area, but neither set the heather on fire further afield. Then, in 1996, after she had insisted on full creative and production control, and allowing a whole raft of her other influences – everything from the Pretenders and Led Zeppelin to the likes of Leonard Cohen and Walt Whitman – to flavour the Latin sound, Pies Descalzos (Barefoot) was released. It debuted at number one in the album charts in eight countries. And it led, not that long after, to her first &quot;crossover&quot; (with some lyrics in English) album, which broke through hugely into America. And then, in 2006 &quot;Hips Don&apos;t Lie&quot;, not only her second US number one (and number one in another 55 countries) but also, to date, the biggest-selling single worldwide this century. Anyone under 35 has danced to it. Anyone under about 45 has probably heard it, or would recognise the brass, and co-composer Wyclef Jean&apos;s cries of &quot;Shakira! Shakira!&quot;. Her name was even in the lyrics: she&apos;d gone global.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You asked,&quot; she tugs me back to my opening, still thinking about it. &quot;You asked why I still do it, why I don&apos;t just stop, and that&apos;s interesting because it&apos;s a matter I used to cover in my sessions with my analyst. After Laundry Service, which was my crossover album, I had already toured the world. And I sat down with my analyst one day, I&apos;ve been seeing him for about eight years, and – not to display the privacy of my sessions but I think I can talk openly now – we were trying to find the motivation for me to continue. Obviously some of the initial drive had been a subconscious motivation to bring my parents joy. Both had had a difficult life, as is life for anyone who has gone through loss, and mourning.&quot;  One of her five half-brothers was killed in a motor-cycle crash, around the time of the bankruptcy. &quot;So I wanted to fill the void in their own lives. They have a happy life together but they&apos;ve had difficult times. Then, later, I wanted to make my own people proud, my home town, my country, this country that has gone through so many difficulties in these past 40 years: and I wanted to keep that promise of making a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;There were so many motivations, but they were all external. And after a while maybe I started to realise that I also counted. And now it&apos;s all for me. I guess that&apos;s why I&apos;m still working, because this time I get to do it for me!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did she ever feel that the urge to please her parents came from competition against her half-siblings, a need to prove she was loved as much? &quot;I understand what you&apos;re getting at, but no. I was the baby, you know, and it meant I was always my father&apos;s little girl. And I still am in some ways. And, yes,  I do have something of an Oedipus complex, which I am  probably still trying to work through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I adore my dad, he&apos;s a 78-year-old man and my inspiration. But now that I feel more like a woman today I understand my mother&apos;s struggle. And also,&quot; her voice lowers, knowingly, &quot;the advantages of being a woman.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shakira struggles for a while, with many giggles, to expand on how she is &quot;becoming a woman&quot; and, though she doesn&apos;t go quite so far as to say this, it&apos;s hard not to feel the subtext is that, for all the sexiness of the videos, the earlier ones were to an extent a teenage girl (educated by, and often performing in front of nuns) dressing up and playing at it, flaunting it because she could, rather than feeling it, and things have only recently begun to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Every day now I discover something new. Go through phases in which I feel much more in touch with my feminine side, in ways I never thought possible. I&apos;m letting  the woman inside of me speak, the desires of this woman, speak as loud as they can.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What, then, if she feels this, does she think the nuns feel? We&apos;re back to the old Latin American dichotomy, bed-breaking raunch versus thin-lipped Catholicism. Do all women have the same desires inside them? Did nuns have the same sexuality inside them as other women?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of course, yes. I do think libido is the engine of the world. Forward or backwards. For good or ill. Sometimes when we repress our libido we regress. When we were in the Dark Ages, it was a question of humanity somehow managing to forget about itself. We put God in the centre of society, and people forgot about their  own nature and desires. There was a huge deal of repression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Until the renaissance, when people could start to… breathe, a little more. Ideas started, or rather resumed. And if this nun I mentioned, the 80-year-old who saw my video, if she was compelled to say something like that, then the rest of us are in a much better place today, right?&quot; Are we really? Was she convinced the world was constantly getting better? I am asking someone who&apos;s not just seen a good bit of the world, and presumably fought off many of its paws, but also sat and listened to self-serving arguments for inaction – and who has also studied the History of Western Civilisation since 2007 (at first anonymously, to avoid being recognised), at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think that things have gotten much better than a few centuries ago. After the industrial revolution a  middle class emerged, and new ideas, too, and it has kept mainly moving forward. Now America has a black president and discrimination and racism are declining every day.  I know that youngsters want to find something in common with each other, and feel closer to each other ideologically through bridges such as the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But we are only now just starting to realise certain truths that we had not… entertained before. For example, poverty: it&apos;s possible to eradicate it. It&apos;s possible to resolve conflict. It&apos;s possible to plan better if we now start feeding and protecting and stimulating children between 0 and 6 years old; and if presidents all over the world start to put education at the  centre of their agendas.&quot; But why, then, not to knock her  fervent hope, but why had we been so godawful to each other for so long, and in so many ways still are?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Because we&apos;re animals as well, and we&apos;re territorial, and we are more often than not put in survival mode, and it becomes the law of the jungle. We follow it when we see our own kind endangered; it&apos;s part of natural selection.&quot; Why in particular, I wondered, did Latin America seem to find it so hard to haul more of itself out of the Third World, out of its drugs and corruption and cyclical poverty? &quot;Well, there are pretty fundamental sociological reasons, historically. Part of it is to do with the fact that when the English came, they travelled with their families, and they settled along with their families. Worked the land, to get their own goods. And, yes, granted, they pretty much exterminated most of the Indian population, but they didn&apos;t subjugate them, make them submit. But when the Spanish came, many of them were on the run, they were criminals, put on this very risky voyage. Without their families. And so they raped and slaved and subjugated, and then tried to convert them. And that has certainly left a trauma mindset on the whole of the continent. The leftovers of colonialism… we&apos;re still eating them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-five million children in Latin America receive no access to education of any kind. &quot;A lot of families earn less than $2 a day,&quot; Shakira says, &quot;and they think that&apos;s normal. Poverty traps them, and they can see no way to break the cycle. Education is the only way forward in Latin America and developing countries in general.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shakira&apos;s Pies Descalzos [Bare Feet] Foundation, which she started at 19, has so far provided education and jobs for over 30,000 Colombians. Wider Latin America now has 54 million children aged 5 and under, 32 million of whom live in poverty: this she has more recently attempted to address by co-founding Falas (Fundacion América Latina en Acción Solidaria), a broad coalition of artists, writers and musicians attempting to kick-start similar, wider projects over the continent. &quot;It&apos;s the only way out of this awful set of circumstances, where if people are born poor then they die poor, and accept it. I never thought it was fair for an 8-year-old child not to be able to afford shoes, or to wander the streets having to beg for money. To know that child&apos;s joy would end soon, when they realised there was no future. In Colombia, in Latin America, the kids are still very smiley, enjoy music, have very high  spirits. And yet you know that society is one day soon going to crush them and any dreams like… cockroaches.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I seldom find difference with the tungsten-sharp opinions of the friend who texted me earlier, but I think she&apos;s wrong here. Shakira isn&apos;t nutty, far from it. I have seldom met someone, especially in the music world, so sane: I suspect some of the &quot;nutty&quot; thing comes from faintly odd lyrics. The oft-quoted &quot;Lucky that my breasts are small and humble/ So you don&apos;t confuse them with mountains&quot;, and now, from this new album, &quot;I&apos;m feeling kind of abused like a coffee machine in an office&quot; still strike me as far from the worst or stupidest  lyrics of all time, and particularly not from someone who wrote her crossover album, as she&apos;s explained, with a dictionary in one hand and thesaurus in the other. And they even make you think, a little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shakira even apologises for talking too much, when I was about to do the same for keeping her going after her two-hour TV stint: there&apos;s a plane to catch within the hour, to Berlin, to sing at the reunification celebrations. &quot;No, this is good, different from TV. You know what TV&apos;s like, you have to be super-brief, no time to dig into thoughts. I haven&apos;t spoken this much in a while.&quot; All I have time left to ask is about looks. Does she think, does she accept, it might all have been different if she had been… ugly? And was that fair? She is lengthily silent again, fumbles a bit with thanks for the compliment, which is the only piece of disingenuity I&apos;ve seen from her. &quot;Well, some of my favourite singers in the world weren&apos;t precisely the ideal beauties. Pavarotti wasn&apos;t in exactly the best shape. But, you&apos;re right, he was a man, so he could get away with it. But, look, beauty is a good ingredient obviously. If you use it wisely. In the whole recipe. But it shouldn&apos;t be the only dish you serve. Flavour is important. Flavour, and comfort. Beauty, when it&apos;s one-dimensional, it gets old quickly.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What will she be like when old: when, say, 78? &quot;Wrinkled. I&apos;ll be wrinkled, definitely. Still dancing? Don&apos;t know. I hope I can at least be flexible. So I want to be 70, 80, and at least move… lightly, and feel young. My dad is a good example. He&apos;s 78 but says he feels like he&apos;s 40. And looks like he&apos;s 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;And I&apos;d like to know that when I&apos;m 78 I won&apos;t be alone.  I don&apos;t care about how I will be remembered. Human beings in general have a very short memory. They&apos;ll remember me for maybe six months, a year, maybe 10 or 20 if I&apos;ve done something really outstanding. But what is that in the big scale of the universe? No, I just want to grow old with a man who takes care of me, and I want to eventually have kids, and want them to be good children to me. Just want to be treated nice and have respect.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She leans into my farewell handshake to proffer instead a double-kiss, and adds: &quot;Till next time I see you then. I&apos;ll look forward to it.&quot; Extraordinarily, I slightly believe she slightly means it.★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She-Wolf is out now. The single &quot;Did it again&quot; is released 14 December&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355670161|2009-11-25T21:07:12|2a2de148cefa110dafb0bd26319e72a197d99f7b --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;All the women in my family are very glamorous, in leopard print and furs – like Elizabeth Taylors without the surgery. They were young in the 60s, so they still feel the liberation of fashion. My mum, who burned her bra, thinks it&apos;s hilarious that I wear corsets and stockings. She says I&apos;m trussing myself up like a slave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At eight I went to a fancy-dress party as my idol, Charlie Chaplin, but my mum didn&apos;t want to buy a bowler hat, so she drew one, 2D, on card. The shame. These days I&apos;m always fancy dressed. I&apos;m a master of the costume. At 10,  I plastered my walls with pictures of Marilyn Monroe. Marilyn taught me to accentuate my curves – I have a difference of 11 inches between my waist and hips, which I&apos;m proud of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I grew up in London, and as a teenager  I changed my look every four months. I was a hippy, then I started wearing Reebok Classics. Then came the hip-hop and ragga, a gold nose ring, and my hair done in little curls plastered  to the side of my face. I got my souly voice when I was into UK garage, wearing Patrick Cox loafers and lots and lots of Morgan de Toi. I got heavily into Nubian culture, and wore beads and African-print headwraps. Then vintage, with Manish Arora and Zara thrown in. My wardrobe is full of costumes. I find it hard not to dress for show, but at home I&apos;ll be in 40s men&apos;s trousers and braces. The coal-miner look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve had hassle for the way I dress. I was quite experimental at school, and my friend and I got into trouble with the headmistress a few times. Recently a stranger sang &quot;Follow the yellow brick road&quot; at me in the street, which I liked, and I&apos;ve had people go: &quot;What have you come as?&quot; Now I&apos;m becoming a pop star, though, the way I dress appears more acceptable. I&apos;m allowed to dress like a twat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My style icons are the tragic heroines – Edith Piaf, Billie Holiday, Marilyn, Marlene, Mae West and Josephine Baker, plus people like Björk and Grace Jones. They&apos;re all strong but masked, in disguise. They can all switch the theatre off, which is a liberating idea. Coming home from work. Escaping. I&apos;d never wear the clothes of my teens again, and I&apos;d never wear Ugg boots. A friend once told me, and I agree, that comfort is for tossers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Paloma Faith&apos;s album Do You Want The Truth Or Something Beautiful? is out now on Epic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355741211|2009-11-25T21:07:12|631b0db06e1fefd42cfd50a47d7e457e086eaa94 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;After a couple of years when Britain&apos;s leading new-music festival seemed to be losing its way in a welter of improvisation, installations and electro-acoustic environments, it&apos;s more like business as usual in Huddersfield this November. Premieres abound, and the roster of visiting ensembles is impressive by any standards. As if to signal the change of tack, the festival opened with a UK premiere from one of Europe&apos;s leading composers, Wolfgang Rihm, delivered by the Hilliard Ensemble and Arditti Quartet in St Paul&apos;s Hall just five days after its first performance in Cologne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rihm&apos;s hour-long –ET LUX– is a requiem of sorts. The fragmentary Latin text comes from the requiem mass, though it&apos;s only decipherable when isolated words emerge from the dense four-part textures. The string quartet traces a series of etiolated, rather Nono-like ideas against the somewhat archaic-sounding vocal writing. There are few climaxes, or even moments when the voices and strings unite in anything like a common purpose, yet the result is quietly attractive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Huddersfield contemporary music festival continues until Sunday.

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sonny Rollins won a standing ovation for the storm of sound he unleashed on the London Jazz festival a week ago. In the event&apos;s last days, Sir John Dankworth played just one tender tune on the alto saxophone, and the Royal Festival Hall, to a man, woman and child, rose to give the same accolade. Dankworth&apos;s recent hospitalisation had threatened to rule him out of this long-planned concert with his wife Cleo Laine, daughter Jacqui and son Alec, plus a big band, choir and string quartet. When he emerged in a wheelchair, his family and a good many listeners looked to be holding their breath as he hesitantly brought the sax to his mouth. Then Dankworth&apos;s long-honed alto tone, coolly romantic with a woody, clarinet-like edge, filled the hall with Duke Ellington&apos;s Tonight I Shall Sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this was by no means a gig that hinged only on respect for the fortitude of what Laine called &quot;two old codgers&quot;, despite the pair&apos;s immense contribution to music. It was an entertaining, varied and accomplished show celebrating traditional songwriting, notably Johnny Mercer&apos;s. Laine, making a walking stick look like a natural accessory to an evening gown, was astonishing on the ethereal It Amazes Me and a stingingly propulsive It Don&apos;t Mean a Thing If It Ain&apos;t Got That Swing – as much in control of her organ-pipe low tones, piccolo upper range and actor&apos;s timing as she ever was in almost 60 years on the road. But her daughter Jacqui&apos;s mellow, soulful voice, and the craft of violinist Chris Garrick (improvising on a Bach medley), bassist Alec Dankworth and trombonist/MD Mark Nightingale kept her admirable company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere during the closing LJF weekend, Italian pianist Stefano Bollani proved how irresistibly improv, lyricism and knockabout comedy could combine at Kings Place, demonically grinning guitar virtuoso Charlie Hunter funked Ronnie Scott&apos;s into a noisy trance, and the Scottish jazz scene further raised its high credit rating with a free South Bank showcase including a punchy trio featuring pianist Dave Milligan and drummer Tom Bancroft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355926529|2009-11-25T21:07:12|1210ee107dd5b15adff98b1309392b9493c26218 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Elliott Carter, who will be 101 next month, is the giant redwood of American composers; a force of nature who keeps&amp;nbsp;acquiring annual rings and seems capable of going on forever. Carter has said that his harmonically restless, rhythmically complex compositions require at least 10 years for musicians to&amp;nbsp;fully explore their depths. Heinz Holliger has spent twice that amount of time unpicking the enigma of Oboe Concerto, composed for him when Carter was a mere 80 years old. Holliger is without doubt one of the finest oboists on the planet and an authority on Carter&apos;s music. Yet he still peered at the score as if its strange language were something he was only just beginning to&amp;nbsp;understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The piece requires the soloist to produce a vast array of sounds, not all of them pretty. It would require another skilled oboist to tell you if some of the more extreme squeals and rasps are exactly as represented on the page. Yet during the incantatory slow section, Holliger&apos;s astringent sound softened into a sublime singing tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Zehetmair brought a satisfying balance to the programme, bookending the Carter between one of Haydn&apos;s most mournful symphonies and one of Schubert&apos;s cheeriest. The lachrymose adagio of Haydn&apos;s Symphony no. 99 is sometimes interpreted as a funerary tribute to Mozart; while the jocular woodwind arpeggios of Schubert&apos;s &quot;Little&quot; Symphony in C sound like a tribute to Rossini. The Northern Sinfonia responded to the programme with a bipolar expression of light and shade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355926595|2009-11-25T21:07:12|10adf02f70c39538bbe6a0051c43fd60e649a0ed --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;The 10-day London Jazz Festival ends tonight, leaving the capital&apos;s jazz community more than usually dazed and confused. We all start off making long and impractical wish lists and end up defeated by musical indigestion and, with the more remote events taking place in Richmond and Croydon, by sheer geography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My number-one target was Sonny Rollins, the &quot;saxophone colossus&quot;. Seventy-nine is not an outlandish age these days, but of his jazz generation, the one that destroyed itself with hard drugs, there are few survivors and none as eminent as Rollins. His improvisations no longer run to the epic length of a few years ago, but he and his five-piece band played nonstop for more than an hour and a half at the Barbican last Saturday and his phenomenal ingenuity, a kind of musical lateral thinking, never flagged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some respects, Rollins is a very traditional jazz musician. He sticks to the structures he grew up with, the 12-bar blues and the 32-bar song, plus some Caribbean ditties he picked up as a youngster. But from these simple materials he draws endless streams of melody, by turns witty, elegant, whimsical and funky. His love of old show tunes is renowned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he was in London, he announced, he would now play a piece by Noël Coward, and embarked on &quot;Some Day I&apos;ll Find You&quot;. After rummaging about in it entertainingly for some time, he drew his solo to a close by slyly interpolating the last eight bars of &quot;I&apos;ll See You Again&quot;. A classic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rollins is such an individualist that no sane person would ever try to imitate him. On the other hand, Branford Marsalis (who appeared at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Monday night) should serve as a model for a generation of young saxophonists. In the matter of sheer technical perfection, the only possible comparison is with the late Stan Getz, but Marsalis achieves it on both tenor and soprano saxophones. And, as with Getz, tone is at the heart of it. On tenor, Marsalis&apos;s sound is full and fibrous and his precise articulation at high speed is almost unbelievable. On soprano, in slow ballads especially, his pristine, vibratoless tone is a distillation of calm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banjo is the butt of many jokes, mainly because, over the years, it has been so execrably played in jolly, boater trad bands. But there are banjos and banjos. The five-string variety is a virtuoso instrument in bluegrass music and that&apos;s where Béla Fleck started out. It&apos;s a long way from there to playing duets with Chick Corea, which he did on Sunday at the Barbican.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His own band features the brothers Wooten – bass guitarist Victor and percussionist Reggie (playing an electronic box of tricks, slung round his neck like a guitar) – and the phenomenal pianist and harmonica player Howard Levy. They put on quite an act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basic rhythmic unit of bluegrass is the semiquaver, which, in layman&apos;s terms, means a million notes going past in a mighty blur. Somewhat rattled by this, plus Victor juggling with the bass while playing it and Reggie (dressed for some reason as a pirate, in a tricorn hat) playing his gadget with one hand and drums with the other, I just sat there in a state of helpless stupefaction. But, as Dr Johnson remarked, the pleasures of sudden wonder are soon exhausted and an hour of it was more than enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After joining Fleck for a friendly duet, Chick Corea introduced his Power of Three: himself on piano, Stanley Clarke on double bass and drummer Lenny White – three-quarters of the original Return to Forever, in fact. They are among the finest contemporary players and couldn&apos;t sound merely average, even if they tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to be at once so casual and so sharp comes only after working together over long years. If you saw the classic Oscar Peterson Trio at work, you&apos;ll know what I mean. The half-smile on Clarke&apos;s face, as he followed some of Corea&apos;s trickier moves, said it all. I don&apos;t think you get this kind of interaction in any form of music but jazz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The London Jazz Festival prides itself on being up to the minute, but I couldn&apos;t help noticing that all the bands (except Rollins, who&apos;s a law unto himself) stuck to the time-honoured programme strategy of building up to hysterical climax, topped off with a spectacular, flailing drum solo. This can be relied  on to elicit cheers and whoops and rarely fails to bring a standing ovation. It&apos;s comforting to know that some things never change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355803088|2009-11-25T21:07:12|96eb6e02741f47a3e4b11f08097d0ab74a1c6c7e --&gt;</body>

      <type-specific class="article">
        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t know where to even start with Aaron Cohen. With his day job, springing imprisoned girls out of brothels? With his past life as a heroin addict? Or the fact that he used to be on the payroll of alternative-rock band Jane&apos;s Addiction, his job description hovering somewhere between &quot;manager&quot; and &quot;spiritual guru&quot;? Or that he refers to himself as a &quot;priest&quot; and studies the Bible for at least an hour every morning? Or that both Steven Spielberg and Oliver Stone have been vying to buy the rights to his book Slave Hunter: One Man&apos;s Global Quest to Free Victims of Human Trafficking, and turn his life into a film?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I worry, though, about how believable that would be. There are moments reading the book when I wonder if he&apos;s not a bit of a fantasist: the facts of his life seem so incredible. The rock-band antics, the years of Kabbalah study, the infiltration of criminal gangs and consorting with drug smugglers and human traffickers. He&apos;s larger than life, and when I meet him this turns out  to be literally true: he&apos;s 6ft 5in, 44 and has the most unnerving gaze of almost anyone I&apos;ve ever met. I keep going to the loo just to be able to stare at a blank wall and have five minutes&apos; respite. There&apos;s an almost messianic passion that Cohen brings to bear on the subject of human trafficking: it is his life&apos;s work and, he believes, part of  a divine plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can&apos;t help thinking that if he&apos;d been born in a different time, he might have been mistaken for a prophet. This is not a man who is short on charisma: on the day I meet him, he&apos;s going on to Reno to talk about slavery to 10,000 people at a music festival, right before the headline act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it turns out the book isn&apos;t unbelievable enough. Cohen says that he and his co-writer Christine Buckley, a journalist, actually had to tone the story down. &quot;Oh, there&apos;s lots we had to take out. The time I was shot. And the time someone attempted to poison me. We just thought it was too OTT, so we simply took it out.&quot; The shooting and the poisoning is because of Cohen&apos;s very own personal one-man mission: as well the campaigning and advocacy work he does against human trafficking, he also travels the world &quot;freeing slaves&quot;. They&apos;re often girls and children who&apos;ve been sold to brothels, and his work involves posing as a customer, befriending them, videoing them giving evidence, and then returning with cash and a paramilitary unit in order to secure their release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slave Hunter begins with the account of one of these missions in Cambodia, and he tells the story of the children who were released, including two sisters, Jonny and Jonty, to whom he became particularly close. When I turn up at his house in Costa Mesa, an hour south of Los Angeles in Orange County, the first thing he shows me is a picture of them. Jonny flourished. She graduated from high school and is now the manager of a beauty salon and helps mentor girls in danger of being trafficked. &quot;But Jonty&apos;s dead,&quot; he says. &quot;She was sold at age 11; I found her at age 13, got her out and got her into a great shelter with the best care you could possibly get. And she had four years of schooling and a high school education.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;But she ran away to do drugs again. The traffickers had broken her with methamphetamine so she ended up hopping the fence and running away from the shelter. She died last year of liver failure. That&apos;s the thing,&quot; he says. &quot;You never know why some people can rise above it and survive. And others don&apos;t.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aaron Cohen is the surviving kind. You don&apos;t have to be a professional psychologist to see links between the events of his childhood and his vocation as an adult. He was a sickly child, asthmatic, frequently off school and picked on by his violent father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was never &quot;normal&quot;, he says. &quot;I&apos;m the kid who wanted the green shoes. I always wanted things that weren&apos;t normal. My brother and sister were happy with ordinary things, but I always felt I was outside the box. I was really ill as a child; I&apos;d stay at home and listen to the other kids play outside. And because of my really severe asthma, I learned to meditate and control my breathing when I was three years old, and it really changed my outlook on life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most profoundly, his mother was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1969, when he was just four years old. She had a hysterectomy and a double mastectomy, and the rest of his childhood was shadowed by the threat of her death. She lived for another two decades, but it&apos;s a shadow that never seems to have left Cohen. She was a religious Jew and very spiritual and it was she, he says, who taught him how &quot;to see the light in people&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What about men you see having sex with underage girls? Do you see the light in them?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I struggle,&quot; he says. &quot;But I think it is why I&apos;m successful at what I do because I wouldn&apos;t just go into a brothel looking for bad guys and good guys. I go in thinking: &apos;We&apos;re all interconnected, there&apos;s light in this pimp, there&apos;s light in this child who&apos;s in sex slavery, there&apos;s light in this bodyguard, this Mafia guy&apos;; and when you look at the bright side, I think that&apos;s the key to a lot of things in life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s tough, though. Cohen&apos;s work takes him to places that most people don&apos;t even want to know exist. &quot;I pull back the first curtain and see a naked old man thrusting himself into a girl half his size,&quot; he writes. &quot;He is killing her soul.&quot; At one point, after a night spent looking for child prostitutes, he reads his guidebook and all the charming sights the city has to offer. It&apos;s like he&apos;s visiting a parallel &quot;zombie&quot; version of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the girls that Cohen tries to rescue. There are various methods he uses, but often it&apos;s a matter of buying their freedom. And then placing them in refuges where some of them thrive, and some of them, like Jonty, don&apos;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was another lesson, he says, that he learned from his mother. &quot;She is what led me into helping victims because I realised that your attitude is everything. Anybody else in my mother&apos;s situation would have died in 1969. But my mother had an attitude and a spirit that lent itself towards life, towards healing. As a young child, I was able to learn that from a desperate woman who was dying. And I meditated on it my whole life. And when I found desperate women who were dying, I was able to make them believe they could make it instead of turning away.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of how he went from a sickly suburban kid to a one-man anti-slavery army makes perfect sense to Cohen. But narrative-wise, it&apos;s a long and twisting story, taking in a water-polo scholarship to Pepperdine University in Malibu, the discovery of the punk grunge scene in downtown LA and the entirely flukish circumstances that led him into Perry Farrell&apos;s orbit: Jane&apos;s Addiction was looking for a writer to collaborate on a project, and the band&apos;s manager read in the local paper that Cohen had won a fiction competition and got in touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They hit it off immediately. &quot;I think we each felt we had found a soul brother. Over the course of the next few years, I would play the translator, on-tour road manager, best friend and all-night recording buddy,&quot; he writes in the book. &quot;Soon after that, Perry introduced me to heroin.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen lived the rock&apos;n&apos;roll lifestyle. And not any old rock&apos;n&apos;roll lifestyle. Jane&apos;s Addiction were notoriously wild drugged-up exhibitionists. The first time he saw them performing, Perry Farrell appeared on stage naked covered in blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point, when he was producing a film project with them, he found that his job involved scoring sufficient drugs to get the cast &quot;well&quot; enough to film. And in the book, he says that &quot;alongside Perry I saw myself as an addict-artist; a character in a supernatural horror story who needed to experience that kind of transformation in order to feel alive&quot;. Later his role turned into Perry&apos;s spiritual guru. Their mornings involved going surfing together and then coming home to study the Kabbalah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until, eventually, he gave up the drugs. And replaced them with religion. He moved back home, got clean, and chose for his graduate thesis the subject of &quot;jubilee&quot;. &quot;Jubilee is something that happens once every 50 years, and it was the ancient law of forgiving debts and freeing slaves. I became really inspired, because jubilee was this sort of divine plan for times of trouble based upon this geopolitical clash of society that was supposed to happen some time in the future. And the year was 1991, the year of the first Gulf War.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a concept that Cohen took up and ran with. In 1998, the 50th anniversary of the state of Israel, he and Jane&apos;s Addiction travelled to the Middle East to declare a jubilee. &quot;And we did a show called Prophecy with the Chemical Brothers and Run DMC. And then in the year 2000, the Pope declared an official jubilee. And a British woman set up Jubilee 2000, a campaign aimed at reducing debt. It included a Vatican scholar, and he happened to have seen an interview with me and Perry talking about jubilee in, of all places, Playboy. And they approached Perry and said: &apos;Can you recruit musicians for this Drop the Debt campaign?&apos; And I was Perry&apos;s executive director, so the request came through me, and I just thought: &apos;Wow, this is a divine miracle!&apos; So we pulled out Perry&apos;s Rolodex and contacted David Bowie and Bono and all these people, and they all came on board.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was one of the most successful campaigns in history: 27m signatures were obtained, and $300bn of debt was wiped out in a single stroke. For Cohen, though, it didn&apos;t stop there. The concept of &quot;jubilee&quot;, the forgiving of debt and the freeing of slaves, has gone on to inform all aspects of his life ever since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s hard to really get to grips with Cohen&apos;s take on religion. He refers to himself as a &quot;man of faith&quot; and says that Judaism is his favourite religion but Jesus is his favourite religious figure. In secular Britain we have no context for him, and when I ask him about the Kabbalah and the way all these Hollywood celebs &quot;like Demi Moore&quot; have jumped on the bandwagon, he says: &quot;I know Demi Moore, actually. She&apos;s a friend of mine. I was at hers on Wednesday night, and she&apos;s a really learned woman. She&apos;s seeking wisdom. Hats off to her and Ashton ? they&apos;re leading their lives through study.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But mostly he&apos;s simply an old-fashioned humanitarian. He travels constantly, to Burma, to Nicaragua, to Iraq. He&apos;s uncovered evidence of a trade in enriched uranium in Burma, and he&apos;s trained law-enforcement officers in human trafficking in a host of different countries. And he has an uncanny knack of being in the right place at the right time. &quot;People often make the joke that I&apos;m like Forrest Gump. Ricky Martin doesn&apos;t show up, so I spend an afternoon with the Dalai Lama. And who would think that I&apos;d be in Sudan getting evidence on slavery that ends up going to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee? Is it chance? I&apos;m a man of faith, so I see it as providence.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence led to the Senate passing the  Trafficking Victim Protection Act of 2000. &quot;And that flagship law funded a $100m-a-year infrastructure, and that led to other laws not just in the US but in European countries. Before that, human trafficking wasn&apos;t even recognised. Now we&apos;re where we were with the war on drugs in the late 60s and early 70s ? we&apos;re just tapping the surface.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Slave Hunter, Cohen writes that it&apos;s estimated that 27 million people are enslaved today ? double the number taken from Africa during the three and a half centuries of the slave trade. Approximately 80,000 new victims are trafficked across international borders each year. And as well as lobbying and campaigning and collecting evidence on victims for various government agencies and human rights organisations, Cohen has also formulated his own hands-on direct response. He calls it &quot;night-frighting&quot;, liberating women and children from brothels, a strategy he developed after watching federal agents in action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I thought: &apos;Oh man, there&apos;s no way you&apos;re going to be able to do this! You&apos;re ordering Pepsi!&apos; They looked so out of place there was no way they were going to pass. Whereas I am a party boy and I come from an elite party group. I can look the part.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s funny, I say, how the skills you&apos;ve brought to bear have been refined through hanging out with a rock&apos;n&apos;roll band. There&apos;s not so many things in life that you could say that about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yeah. I think there&apos;s a purpose for everything in life. And there&apos;s a reason I sowed my wild oats with the punk rock circus for as long as I did, because I learned skills that would become valuable to me later on.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It hasn&apos;t been without its price, though. &quot;Most women have a hard time accepting that I spend my time in brothels looking for underage sex slaves,&quot; he writes in the book. &quot;The reality is this: I get close to the women I meet on the job. This might mean that they end up sitting on my lap or hanging on my neck while we&apos;re talking in a karaoke bar. Some of them have even stayed overnight in my hotel room ? which definitely goes against official rules. I have cuddled and even kissed a few of these women.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s only by establishing an emotional connection with the girls or women that he&apos;s able to get them to trust him, he says. But it reads a little uncomfortably. There&apos;s an incident with a woman called Naomi who he admits he was attracted to. &quot;I&apos;m a man, so it can be difficult. I have to tie myself to the mast. But what you have to remember is that there were no models to follow. I was pioneering this field. And I learned that if I&apos;m a little looser than the man in black, I can get a lot more information, and that means more child rescue. So as long as I&apos;m not having sex and I&apos;m not doing drugs, then I&apos;m all right.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&apos;s more, when he hasn&apos;t been looking for underage sex slaves, he was back, living in his childhood home, caring for his sick father, who has since died. When I turn up at the house, Cohen is packing. He and his siblings remortgaged the house to pay for their father&apos;s care, and it&apos;s being repossessed by the bank. When they took out the mortgage, it was worth $800,000. But it&apos;s now worth $400,000 and they&apos;re in negative equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the house I meet his girlfriend Jennifer, briefly. She works with victims of abuse and understands his work better than most, but it&apos;s been an on-off affair. &quot;It was really hard for her, and she broke up with me. But now we have an understanding that when I&apos;m on missions we&apos;re not together ? that&apos;s her way of coping.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&apos;d like to have children one day, he says, but he&apos;s &quot;damaged goods&quot;. He describes Jennifer not just as his girlfriend but his &quot;therapist&quot; too. &quot;By grace or goodness I have a relationship with someone who loves psychology and who was a victim herself and has in many ways become my mentor.&quot; He worries that his work has dehumanised him. He believes he suffers from something akin to post-traumatic stress disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people are able to simply turn away and ignore problems that are not their own. We deal with injustice and desperation by pretending not to see it. Cohen doesn&apos;t. He&apos;s made it his life&apos;s work. It&apos;s hard not to reach the conclusion  that we&apos;re the ones who&apos;ve been dehumanised. He&apos;s the normal one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;?

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ladies and gentlemen… Jedward!&quot; announces Radio 1 DJ Jo Whiley, as candlelight flickers on the stained glass of this working church. The Little Noise Sessions – an annual fortnight of bijou band sets in aid of Mencap – has become renowned for its cameos as much as its pared-down performances. U2, Chris Martin and the Killers have all rolled up incognito in past years. But mild confusion reigns as Richard Hawley&apos;s fans file in. One listings outlet imagines American unknowns Hockey are on the bill tonight; other whispers suggest the guest is Sting, whose daughter, Coco Sumner, opens the running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the X Factor twins? No one believes that for a second. &quot;Very droll,&quot; murmurs Arctic Monkey Alex Turner, who drops in along with Arctics guitarist Jamie Cook on their one night off their current UK tour. Probably the finest lyricist of his generation, Turner rarely plays solo, making this seven-song set a genuine treat. A rumple of hair offset by some sharp tailoring, he is joined by an organist for a cover of the Ink Spots&apos;s &quot;I Don&apos;t Want To Set The World On Fire&quot; and Dion&apos;s &quot;Only You Know&quot;, two thoughtful oldies whose sentiments chime with the genteel warmth generated by the latter half of the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arctic Monkeys&apos;s latest album, Humbug, isn&apos;t as immediate as its predecessors, but it is no less fine. The current single, &quot;Cornerstone&quot;, is a miniature study in longing, delivered through shut eyes and scuffed vocal chords. Turner plays two brand new songs, &quot;Joining the Dots&quot; and an unspecified second. This closing number – about a romantic assignation in a park – reaffirms his gift for finding beauty in the mundane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mundane clearly fascinates Coco Sumner, model, actress, daughter of Sting and Trudie Styler, and up&apos;n&apos;coming troubadour as well. Raised in boho privilege, Sumner has gravitated towards a rollicking, ramshackle look and sound that owes a bit to Peter Doherty. Backed by a four-piece, she hides behind lank hair, exposing long bare twigletty legs that end in bovver boots. Her acoustic guitar is held on by a bit of string.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online, the works of I Blame Coco tend towards reggae-ish pop, probably reflecting the jukebox at the Sumner Tuscan holdings. It&apos;s a sound ripe for the reinterpreting, now that Lily Allen has forsaken Londoner ska-lite for something more sleek. Tonight, though, the Caribbean influences are toned right down, and Coco leads her pleasant-enough band into the middle of the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it wears on, the career of Sumner fille will make a case study for those studying the effects of nature versus nurture. Coco&apos;s nicely husky voice falls easily into phrasing and intonations that millions of Police fans will instantly recognise. Still, the nascent I Blame Coco are not all derivative, and if you had to push one celebrity offspring out of the boat it would be Peaches Geldof every time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite I Blame Coco&apos;s London-Kingston-Florence axis, and an appearance from Leeds songbird Corinne Bailey Rae, this is really a Sheffield love-in. When Arctic Monkeys won the Mercury Music Prize ahead of fellow Sheffield totem Richard Hawley in 2006,  Turner claimed in his acceptance speech that the retro steeltown crooner had been robbed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That clannish good feeling remains mutual. For his part, Hawley is unrecognisable from his days as Pulp&apos;s latterday guitarist. Then, he had a reputation as a very bad man. Now he sings almost exclusively about love and wields an acoustic guitar inlaid with his name in pearl. His pomaded hair and just-so drapes reinforce the fantasy of Roy Orbison reborn as a Yorkshireman. Hawley&apos;s exemplary band (double bass, drums, mandolin, lap steel and so on) wind their way elegantly around old favourites like &quot;Born Under A Bad Sign&quot; and recent outings from this year&apos;s Truelove&apos;s Gutter album. But the Little Noise mandate (make it special, make it cosy) manifests itself best when Alex Turner joins Hawley for a version of Arctic Monkeys&apos;s &quot;Only Ones Who Know&quot;. &quot;I wanted to do one of his,&quot; apologises Turner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What he does n&apos;t say is that the Monkeys original sounds like a Hawley homage. The song ends on a great unexpected scrape of steel strings, as Sheffield a sound as these fiercely proud sons could want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355875019|2009-11-25T21:07:12|6519d14435dc0cef8e234509e3002c29af4cc773 --&gt;</body>

His mission is to persuade us that this is indeed an opera rather than a musical, with big voices and superbly pungent, edgy orchestral playing from the Chamber Orchestra of Europe. Jonathan Lemalu&apos;s Porgy is lyrical but understated, and Isabelle Kabatu&apos;s Bess huge but unintelligible; Roberta Alexander as Maria and Gregg Baker as Crown both shine.

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Mind-blowing is one of those expressions best allowed out every five years at most. This quinquennial airing greets the UK premiere of Alfred Schnittke&apos;s extraordinary The History of D Johann Faustus, part of the London Philharmonic Orchestra&apos;s Between Two Worlds festival lovingly devised by conductor Vladimir Jurowski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schnittke, who would have been 75 this year, completed the opera just before a long and final incapacitating illness which led to his death in 1998. It was premiered, heavily cut, at the Hamburg State Opera in 1995, but the Russian-Jewish-German composer was already in hospital. Incomprehensibly, it hasn&apos;t been seen since, though part has been recorded as a Faust Cantata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LPO performed extended excerpts, with Stephen Richardson (formidable and sympathetic in the title role), Anna Larsson, Andrew Watts and Markus Brutscher as superb soloists and the Chamber Choir of the Moscow Conservatory providing a lustrous array of whispers, chant and Orthodox-style polyphony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either box-office nerves or the absence of a complete performing edition influenced the remainder of the concert: Haydn&apos;s Philosopher Symphony No 92 and Wagner&apos;s Prelude and Good Friday Spell from Parsifal. True, the choice made for intelligent programming, gleamingly played with the Haydn in crisp, period-instrument style, the Wagner resplendent and never clotted. But what a loss not to have heard the whole of the opera, which runs at under two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the familiar story of Faust entering a pact with the devil, Schnittke presents us with a devastating showcase of multiple musical styles, from the narrative urgency of a Bach Passion to ear-bending avant-garde vocal experiment, requiring the singers to swoop up octaves and ninths to fiendish falsetto excess. Even if you know Schnittke&apos;s oeuvre, the orchestral timbres here are so unusual that it&apos;s like discovering a new spice. The score drips with a wealth of keyboard instruments, including piano, celeste, organ and harpsichord, as well as synthesisers and tuned percussion. Saxophones and bass trombone add grip and opulent sonority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The climactic, sleazy tango extravaganza, straight out of naughty Lola-Lola in The Blue Angel, was glossy and macabre. You can label it &quot;polystilistic&quot;, the inadequate epithet usually applied to Schnittke, meaning essentially &quot;tutti frutti&quot;. Yet that conveys nothing of the singularity of the composer&apos;s voice or the integrity of musical style, which go straight to the heart. Annabel Arden&apos;s efficient semi-staging, lit in appropriately lurid shades of crimson by Ian Scott, hinted at how exciting this could be on stage. Will someone dare do it and invite Jurowski to conduct? No need for a set. Anish Kapoor&apos;s mountain of globular red wax shrapnel currently splurging forth at the Royal Academy would provide a perfect backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britten, brought back to semi-life in Alan Bennett&apos;s new play, haunted David Sawer&apos;s Rumpelstiltskin, &quot;a grotesque fable for our times&quot;, premiered by the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group who commissioned it. This dance-mime piece was scored for 13 musicians, the magic number chosen by Britten for his Turn of the Screw, and a cue for many chamber theatre pieces since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sawer (born 1961), a gifted colourist, explored extremes of pitch, particularly conspicuous in the frowsy gurgles of muted tuba and bass clarinet, or the intentionally scratchy, ghostly string harmonics. Richard Jones&apos;s cool, sharp direction and Stewart Laing&apos;s versatile wooden box design gave necessary focus to this hybrid work. Six dancer-actors enacted the story with blackly comic gusto. Think twice before taking children. They may not find enough instant gratifications in this fantasy of adult greed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355817486|2009-11-25T21:07:12|67462fd021dd65041df436c43aa4496207247298 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Never has a case of domestic abuse played out as publicly as that of R&amp;amp;B star Rihanna. She was brutally beaten up by her ex-boyfriend, the singer Chris Brown, on the eve of the Grammy awards; within a fortnight, a leaked photo of her bruised, swollen face was plastered across the internet; the subsequent 10 months have seen every titbit of possible gossip regarding her recovery process disseminated and scrutinised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spite of her experience being played out under an unprecedented spotlight, the Bajan R&amp;amp;B star is starting to seize control of her story. Last week, she gave an interview to Diane Sawyer of ABC&apos;s 20/20. The message the 21-year-old articulated, which prioritised emotional honesty over canned PR platitudes, is carried over into Rihanna&apos;s new album, Rated R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dark, even forbidding work, it eschews the club-friendly dance-pop that dominated her last album, 2007&apos;s Good Girl Gone Bad. Instead, Rihanna alternates between wounded, aching balladry and a tough, newly swaggering resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall impression is of a woman rebuilding her broken self-image from scratch – and succeeding on her own terms. &quot;I thought I saw your potential – guess that&apos;s what made me dumb,&quot; she mourns on Stupid In Love – a song that was, in fact, written by Ne-Yo three days before the Grammys incident, and which Rihanna has described as a &quot;premonition&quot;. Elsewhere, she sneers &quot;I never play the victim: I&apos;d rather be a stalker,&quot; on the Slash-featuring Rockstar 101, and on the triumphant Hard, she snaps: &quot;No pain is forever: yup, you know this.&quot; It is an album that rings psychologically true, and provides a fresh insight into how and why Rihanna&apos;s fans find it easy to identify with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A particularly disturbing moment in her interview came when Rihanna reproached herself with the thought that her initial decision to go back to Brown was a &quot;selfish decision for love [that] could result in some girl getting killed&quot;. In the days following Rihanna&apos;s 20/20 interview, calls to the National Domestic Violence Hotline rose by 59% – with the National Teen Dating Abuse Helpline seeing a 73% increase. While Rihanna should not be made into the poster girl for domestic abuse merely by dint of her celebrity stature, she deserves full credit for the way that her words resonated with so many women in similar positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is ironic, of course, that such a shining example of strength and leadership should come from a woman whose image and music had seen her hitherto dismissed by some as an over-sexualised pop cipher; and it is instructive to compare her words with those of a performer who has been sold and accepted, not least by herself, as a positive alternative role model to R&amp;amp;B divas such as Rihanna. Elly Jackson, singer of synthpop outfit La Roux, has gained plaudits for her androgynous image, but opining on domestic abuse, Jackson was quick to blame the victims:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Women wonder why they get beaten up, or have relationships with arsehole men. Because you attracted one, you twat.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Rihanna performs on stage wearing a skimpy leotard, as she did this week at a comeback showcase concert at Brixton Academy, she may attract the ire and contempt of the likes of Jackson. But if public figures must be role models, it is a no-brainer as to which is preferable: the acceptably unsexy but essentially misogynist one, or the glamorous pop star whose words and music have negotiated a crucial feminist issue with aplomb and had a real, positive impact on women&apos;s lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is comment. GNM does not necessarily support the views expressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355876531|2009-11-25T21:07:12|185beaa7def3757909d83c6db3df75e1029f7c51 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;The King of Pop, Michael Jackson, has turned out to be an auctioneers&apos; dream celebrity as prices for Jacko memorabilia outstrip even those for items that belonged to Elvis Presley or Marilyn Monroe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of bidders from around the world were attracted to the Jackson auction at the Hard Rock Cafe in New York, where auctioneers were taken aback by the big prices paid for some of the late star&apos;s belongings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rhinestone-encrusted white glove worn by Jackson when he first Moonwalked in 1983 was sold for $350,000 (£212,000) – nine times the expected price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glove was one of 70 items, including a jacket, a fedora hat, lyrics, drawings, autographs and even a dental mould, which sold for $2m, well above pre-sale estimates of $120,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jacket worn by Jackson on his 1989 Bad tour was sold for $225,000, while the fedora went for $22,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most bizarre item was the upper dental mould used to fit the singer with animal fangs for his 1983 Thriller video. It sold for more than $10,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson&apos;s glove is an iconic item, appearing in one of the world&apos;s most copied dance moves. It was also used by MTV this year in a Jackson tribute and promotional video for its video music awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The glove was bought by Hoffman Ma, a Hong Kong businessman, on behalf of a hotel in Macau, China, where it will go on display.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celebrity auctions bring rich pickings. Earlier this year, Barbra Streisand auctioned more than 400 personal items, including dresses, wigs and a baby grand piano, to raise money for charity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, Presley memorabilia including locks of the star&apos;s hair – allegedly from his 1958 army haircut – and concert scarves sold for thousands of dollars in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the Bernie Madoff car boot sale will soon be upon us, with lots including a duck decoy belonging to the convicted fraudster going on sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it&apos;s hard to believe that Tom Jones&apos;s strides or Leona Lewis&apos;s frocks would hold quite the same value. Any suggestions for pop memorabilia yet to come to auction that could bring in the dizzying sums raised by Jackson&apos;s auction?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355920913|2009-11-25T21:07:12|eb5a49fece715bd415ef7de95c17d65947a6aebc --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;According to their Wikipedia profile, the Low Anthem use no fewer than 32 instruments in creating their desolate, often beautiful folk-rock, showcased recently on their second album Oh My God, Charlie Darwin. These range from guitar, upright bass and clarinet, to Tibetan singing bowl, tongue drum and fun machine. Whatever a fun machine is, there are none on clear display at the Rhode Island trio&apos;s packed-out London show, but no one could accuse the band of skimping on the instrument budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A time-lapse video of the gig would show Ben Knox Miller, Jeff Prystowsky and Jocie Adams, along with newly recruited friend Matt Davidson, drifting from one side of the stage to the other like seaweed in a tide. After almost every song they swap instruments or pick up new ones. Adams is introduced as the foremost practitioner of the folk crotales – antique cymbals played with a bow to create a ringing sound – and at one point Knox Miller locates music in the static between two mobile phones and a microphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dredging the darker recesses of Americana, the lyrics concoct scenes of life on the margins, where people are apt to smoke themselves to sleep or comb their hair with a frying pan. Most of the songs are slow and reflective, but occasionally things heat up and the imagery turns apocalyptic. When the sky is invoked, it&apos;s either on fire or about to fall, and people keep a stock of ammo &quot;should society collapse&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the subject matter, and the absence of fun machines, the mood is high and the band seem genuinely delighted by the audience&apos;s goodwill. Sometimes, however, you wonder if there is a justification for all those instruments. The most captivating moment comes on &quot;Cage the Song Bird&quot;, when Knox Miller&apos;s voice, previously a Waitsian growl, rises to a falsetto and all superfluous sounds fall away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355822799|2009-11-25T21:07:12|43573499fbe60fbc7d60efaee84866b41ae7f3e2 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Composers&apos; attitudes to their own works are often curious. Tchaikovsky believed The Tsarina&apos;s Slippers (Cherevichki in Russian; more correctly &quot;little boots&quot; in English) was his finest opera. Posterity has questioned his judgment and will probably continue to do so in the wake of this expensive-looking production that combines the forces of the Royal Opera and the Royal Ballet. It doesn&apos;t, by any means, make a case for the work as a lost masterpiece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tchaikovsky&apos;s source was Nikolai Gogol&apos;s story Christmas Eve, about Oxana, a wilful Ukrainian girl who agrees to marry her blacksmith boyfriend Vakula if he gets her some of Catherine the Great&apos;s footwear. In order to do so, Vakula forces into his service a none-too-bright devil, who is one of the several would-be lovers of his witchy mother Solokha. Their phantasmagoric Christmas Eve journey allows Tchaikovsky to contrast folksy Ukrainean vigour with rarefied 18th-century St Petersburg, as well as painting a rather questionable portrait of a unified Russian empire, blithely preparing for the festive season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The material is uneven, though. The dances are delightful, while Vakula&apos;s moments of doubt permit Tchaikovsky to examine male vulnerability, where he is, of course, supreme. The rest of it, however, is charming if insubstantial. Tchaikovsky, who could turn against his own music if he considered it too self-revealing, probably adored Cherevichki because it is safe and a bit anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francesca Zambello&apos;s big, gaudy staging plays at times to the opera&apos;s weaknesses by emphasising spectacle at the expense of character. There are dancing bears and whirling Cossacks. Catherine&apos;s court spills across the stage from beneath the skirts of a huge gilded statue of the Empress. Choreographer Alastair Marriott serves up mock Petipa in St Petersburg and an elegant divertissement, reminiscent of Ashton&apos;s Ondine, for the water nymphs who distract Vakula on his journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Musically, things could be tighter. The opera needs a stronger conductor than the rather routine Alexander Polianichko. Both Maxim Mikhailov&apos;s devil and Larissa Diadkova&apos;s lubricious Solokha were having problems with their high notes on opening night, while Olga Guryakova&apos;s Oxana was unremittingly loud. On the other hand, Vsevolod Grivnov is a fabulous Vakula, convincing you that he has the soul of a poet in the body of a nerd. And the great Sergei Leiferkus makes a brief but show-stealing appearance as His Excellency, Catherine&apos;s nameless lover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until 8 December.

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;The greater the risk, the more the reward. Fear of failure sometimes looms large and it makes you not enjoy the moment. When you&apos;ve lived enough of life you know that you survive the downs. You can always get up again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t ever say what kind of drugs I was taking. I just call them drugs. I did the Narconon rehabilitation programme and I&apos;ve never touched a drug since. It&apos;s quite brilliant.  It was good to get rid of that struggle really early, at 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Touring ages you. Bus air can&apos;t be good all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve had an empathy for the underbelly all my life. I don&apos;t know why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientology is so common-sense orientated. I&apos;m in the know because I did courses.  I like to be known as me, first of all – that&apos;s the problem with being associated with any religion. Different things in Scientology have helped me become even more of an individual, not a blind follower. People are like: &quot;What? I thought they steal your money.&quot; Nobody&apos;s stealing my money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a romanticist and a pragmatist, an idealist and a realist, it&apos;s a struggle. Those qualities are always duking it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain friends call me Jules from time to time. Never Julie – that does not seem fitting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t think men really try to pick me up, because it&apos;s so awkward. I&apos;ve only recently been like: &quot;Oh, that person&apos;s flirting. Why are they acting so weird?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simple truth is that you have to keep reminding yourself to love and let go. It&apos;s an  airy-fairy statement but it&apos;s a deep, deep concept to keep coming back to and reminding oneself of, especially when you realise that people come and go and this is a mortal existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe in the synergy and recycling of energy, so the sun, being this majestic ball of energy – you must have some of it. That&apos;s why I like California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I appear really intense, but I work in a much lighter way than some other actors. My approach is very make-believe orientated, much like a kid. I&apos;m not a method actor; I don&apos;t stay in character. That would make absolutely no sense for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve dated all kinds of people. I tend to find things that are awkward beautiful. Like crooked teeth, a big nose. I like hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people drink and they can have intellectual discussions. I&apos;m not like that. I like a Guinness every now and then, but I don&apos;t ever lose control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brad Pitt is a relationship I had, I think, 15 years ago. He&apos;s a stand-up guy from Missouri, really honest and decent. People ask me about him just because he&apos;s famous. They don&apos;t really ask about my ex-husband, which is a far more significant relationship because we were married. It&apos;s a great failure to have a marriage end because you create a picture together of a lifelong dream. We&apos;re better as best friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m a good peacemaker. I&apos;m on more of an even keel than people might imagine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn&apos;t find Oliver Stone frightening. He directs a bit like an army sergeant. Scorsese directs with a world of enthusiasm. The only people who are truly frightening are those who don&apos;t have a sense of humour, and Oliver&apos;s a funny guy. He&apos;s not very validating, but he gave  me one compliment during Natural Born Killers and I put that in my pocket. He said: &quot;Juliette, you are a genius at your craft.&quot; We were having dinner, all of the cast, and that stumped me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I have dreams where I&apos;m being chased in an apocalyptic world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Juliette and The Licks play Kingston on 29 November and Portsmouth on 5 December (www.julietteandthelicks.co.uk)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355653117|2009-11-25T21:07:12|8a375d8164794832a597b2f5a424057250043d2f --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Equally accomplished on drums and piano, Jim Hart seems to have settled on the vibraphone, for the time being. He&apos;s able to fit happily into any given context but this is all his own, surprisingly abstract, work. The vibes creates such a sweet sound that even the spikiest lines come over as playful. Alto saxophonist Ivo Neame&apos;s bold attack provides an effective contrast. The absence of a chordal instrument makes for a very open texture, but bassist Jasper Hoiby and drummer Dave Smith fill out the picture with great subtlety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355881994|2009-11-25T21:07:12|854d2e35e07ce293b208ef30b386c00f1626dac3 --&gt;</body>

This 75-minute sequence of overlapping movements is built around a series of poems by Paul Celan, set for soprano and mezzo, and intercut with electronic interludes and quasi-independent instrumental pieces. Everything is amplified and enhanced, if that&apos;s the right word, by Barrett&apos;s electronic improvisations, but the effect is to coarsen and homogenise the music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Huddersfield contemporary music festival continues until Sunday.

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;PICK OF THE WEEK  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lady GagaBad Romance (Universal) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baroness von Sparkytits has spent most of 2009 working on that reverse backlash, bringing haters around to the philosophy of Gaga. Bad Romance, one of the best singles released this year, is preaching from the books of Performance Art, Knickers-as-Trousers and Vampiric Mutant Europop (verse 13, chapter 7). It&apos;s brilliant, unless you&apos;ve never known joy. In which case just focus on the gothy bits while you mope around, grumpo, because there really is something for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La Roux Quicksand (Polydor) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the economy is burning, some glossy fashion magazines are busy fiddling to the tune of &quot;chiconomising&quot;, which is a way of pretending to pander to what&apos;s going on in the world but doing exactly the same as always, ie selling crotchless T-shirts for £600. Quicksand is pure chiconomics, recycling not just a single from 2008 but the video, too. And not to go on about Lady Gaga, but she&apos;s managed to accidentally make and release a whole new album since then, so Quicksand is obviously very good and everything, but maybe it&apos;s worth just having a think about that work ethic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dizzee Rascal Dirtee Cash (Dirtee Stank) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of lazy pop stars, Dizzee Rascal is here to rap about how bad it is that everyone wants to be rich and famous, which, of course, rings hollow when it comes from somebody who&apos;s rich and famous. &quot;Truthfully, it&apos;s like a joke,&quot; warns Dizzee, over a Stevie V sample, &quot;like a bad episode of Hollyoaks.&quot; But if it really was like a bad episode of Hollyoaks then he&apos;d be rapping about the imaginary alter ego of a schizophrenic teenager, psychotic lesbians and fake anorexia. All of which would probably be better than telling people that credit cards are a bit wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penguin Prison Animal Animal (Neon Gold) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the olden days, you used to be able to buy personalised seven-inch records for children&apos;s parties that slipped the first name of the birthday boy or girl into the chorus. It&apos;s a genuine surprise to discover that Animal Animal sounds spookily similar to Side A of Rebecca&apos;s Party Songs, bought in Skegness in 1990, but with added washed-out electro breeziness. Penguin Prison is a New York producer type so Skegness is probably not where he found his inspiration. Still, uncanny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timbaland Morning After Dark (Interscope) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh Timbo, loving you is a hard and thankless feat of endurance. Did you peak too soon? Selflessly use up all your production genius on others and keep nothing back for yourself? Forget that using babies as percussion is what you&apos;re good at, not tedious plodders that should be reported for serious Autotune abuse? Morning After Dark – it&apos;s about going out to clubs and being a wily old dog – already sounds so dated that he might as well have used a harpsichord and put Nelly Furtado and SoShy in bonnets and bustles.

      <type-specific class="article">
        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the most perceptive and admired sopranos of the postwar era, Elisabeth Söderström, who has died aged 82, had a lengthy career that carried on into the 1990s, when she was well into her 60s. In everything she attempted, her vibrantly beautiful singing was enhanced by her good looks and vivid acting. With her sensitive demeanour she was particularly successful at portraying the troubled women who abound in opera, such as Leonore in Beethoven&apos;s Fidelio, Tatyana in Tchaikovsky&apos;s Evgeny Onegin and the Countess in Richard Strauss&apos;s Capriccio, three of the roles with which she delighted audiences at Glyndebourne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was born in Stockholm, the daughter of a Swedish naval captain and a Russian mother, and studied at the Royal Academy and Opera School there. She made her debut as early as 1947, when she was just 20, as Mozart&apos;s Bastienne, in the Drottningholm Court Theatre. Thereafter she joined the Swedish Royal Opera, of which she remained a member throughout the rest of her career. Her roles there stretched from Monteverdi&apos;s Nero (Poppea) through Mozart&apos;s Countess Almaviva (in Figaro, one of her most palpitating portrayals), Strauss&apos;s Octavian and Marschallin (both in Der Rosenkavalier) to Janáček&apos;s Jenůfa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Royal Opera in London, she also loved playing the Governess in Britten&apos;s The Turn of the Screw and Marie in Berg&apos;s Wozzeck, two further distressed women. But she also revelled in lighter things, such as Rosalinde in Die Fledermaus and Saffi in the same composer&apos;s Der Zigeunerbaron (The Gypsy Baron). She sang many of her roles both in Swedish and in the original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ln 1955 she made her debut at the Salzburg Festival, as the boy Ighino in Pfitzner&apos;s Palestrina. She first appeared at Glyndebourne in 1957, as the Composer in Strauss&apos;s Ariadne auf Naxos, and in 1963-64 she was much admired there as Elisabeth Zimmer in Henze&apos;s Elegy for Young Lovers. She made her debut at Covent Garden in 1960, with the Royal Swedish Opera as Daisy Doody in Blomdahl&apos;s Aniara and as Morgana in Handel&apos;s Alcina. She returned there, with the resident company, as Octavian and as an unforgettable Mélisande under Pierre Boulez (1969-70, a role that she recorded with him).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her Metropolitan Opera debut was as Susanna (Figaro) in 1959, followed by Strauss&apos;s Sophie, which meant she had undertaken all three of the women&apos;s roles in Der Rosenkavalier, once joking that she would now have to undertake Baron Ochs. She continued to appear in New York for the following four seasons. One of her later roles, that of the 300-year-old Emilia Marty in Janáček&apos;s The Makropulos Case, was undertaken with, among others, Welsh National Opera, an unforgettable experience, also seen in London. She wonderfully conveyed Marty&apos;s emotional cynicism and boredom at having lived so long. She followed that with the old Countess in Tchaikovsky&apos;s The Queen of Spades, showing that she could still command attention even with reduced resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Söderström often sang in concerts: she appeared at the Royal Festival Hall, London, and in the recording studio with Otto Klemperer in Beethoven&apos;s Missa Solemnis. She was also an accomplished recitalist, singing a wide repertory, but particularly happy in the songs of Sibelius, which she recorded complete in the company of the pianist Vladimir Ashkenazy. She always delighted her audiences by introducing specific items with her particular fey charm, nowhere more successfully than with Mussorgsky&apos;s Nursery cycle. She was also an engaging broadcaster, and often regaled Radio 3 and Radio 4 audiences with her anecdotes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1993 to 1996 she was director of the Drottningholm Palace Theatre, where she had started her career. In retirement, she became an accomplished giver of masterclasses, leavening her lessons with a good deal of humour and general bonhomie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Söderström was one of the most distinguished artists of her generation. The combination of a charming, yet elusive personality, very Swedish in character, with her vibrant voice and sincere acting enhanced all her portrayals, and while she was as happy deploying them on comedy as on drama, it is undoubtedly for her interpretations of the heroines in the operas of Tchaikovsky, Richard Strauss and Janáček that she will be longest remembered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a person, she was the soul of kindness, had a ready wit and was never more at home than when taking part in lively conversation. Colleagues and friends alike were treated generously. In the opera house, she could be demanding, wanting others to meet her own high standards, but she was always co-operative with directors she trusted, and with them she was willing to work as hard and as long as it took to create a result full of inner meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1950 she married Sverker Olow, and he survives her, as do their three sons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Amis writes: When Elisabeth was invited to make her debut in New York at the Metropolitan Opera, she took all three of her sons with her for the season. When they got to school age, she gave up New York and returned to the Royal Opera in Stockholm. This was typical of her approach to a happy marriage, and to being both a wife and a mother. By that point being rather older than many of her colleagues, she developed the knack of being an elder sister to them and coaching them at rehearsals. She excelled in masterclasses, partly through her good nature, but also because she always sought to encourage her students to give their best; at the same time she delighted her audience without ever buttering her own ego (as many masterclass teachers do).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elisabeth giggled and laughed a lot, but that only seemed to complement the seriousness of her devotion to her art. Sometimes she would point out to people who implied that a singer&apos;s life was an easy one, how hard it could be. &quot;Sweat, phlegm and dirty feet is often what it&apos;s about,&quot; she would say. &quot;What do we do all day when not rehearsing? We memorise and that takes up a lot of time, all part of the job. And so is winding down after a performance.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming from a country whose language is comparatively remote from most of the repertoire meant that Elisabeth would often sing in several languages. Some of the Janáček operas, for example, she sang not only in the original Czech, but also in German, English and Swedish. She was the least divaish diva that you could meet. She was a good person, a good friend, good wife, good mother, good humoured and an attractive woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes she had a hard time of it. In Jenůfa once her heel caught in a hole in a floorboard: broken knee. Another time in Offenbach&apos;s La Périchole, she took a dive nearly into the orchestral pit: bad back. Deputising, she was manhandled in the last scene of an unfamiliar version of Gounod&apos;s Faust in which Marguérite does not get wafted to heaven, but bundled down to hell: broken arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elisabeth wrote an informative and readable little book, In My Own Key (1979), and in the photographs of her in various roles you can usually guess which role she was playing just by her facial expression, whether it was Tatyana, Leonore, The Governess, Mélisande, Kát&apos;a Kabanová or the Marschallin or Octavian in Rosenkavalier. She was different in each part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Glyndebourne, we regulars idolised the singer Sena Jurinac, who left Sussex in 1956 when her marriage broke up, leaving her husband Sesto Bruscantini to sing there by himself. We heard that there was some unknown Swedish singer coming to sing Sena&apos;s roles, and we all hated her in advance. But as soon as she sang the Composer in Strauss&apos;s Ariadne, our hatred turned to love and adoration. The Swede was of course Elisabeth Söderström.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Elisabeth Söderström, soprano, born May 7 1927; died 20 November 2009&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Alan Blyth died in 2007&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355885031|2009-11-25T21:07:12|e5a155e39050b55c729187f9ce730c4acbe1700d --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Rihanna&apos;s head soars above the&amp;nbsp;cloud of stylists, photographers, PR people and managers that mill&amp;nbsp;around her, completely disproving the  notion that celebrities tend to be smaller in real life. In her strappy, stompy gladiator heels, with a&amp;nbsp;bronze helmet of hair, long beige nails, eyes rimmed with bright pink shadow, she is statuesque, towering, a picture of power. She stares into the camera, turning her head very deliberately this way and that. As the photographer clicks, a series of perfect images appears on the monitor, not a single one mid-blink or slack-jawed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This professional focus is one side of the R&amp;amp;B singer. The other is playful, uproarious, a reflection of the fact that Rihanna is still only 21, and determined to enjoy herself. And so, before the shoot starts, she mugs and mimes ridiculous poses; she asks her make-up artist to cover a small bruise on her leg, whooping in explanation: &quot;I had some really wild sex last night – just kidding!&quot; She goes for lunch in a side room with&amp;nbsp;her entourage, including old friends from Barbados, and laughter gasps through the closed door. When I ask whether her hard-edged style – futuristic dresses, mesh jumpsuits, trouser suits with enormous, exaggerated shoulders – owes anything to Grace Jones, she says that she&amp;nbsp;loves her, &quot;but Cruella de Vil, from 101 Dalmatians, is my new style icon. She&apos;s just fly.&quot; Her laughter sometimes seems forced – her unhappiest stories can end with a &quot;ha!&quot; – but mostly it comes across as real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, none of this tallies with the most notorious image of Rihanna to emerge this year, in a picture taken in February by the Los Angeles Police Department. It was snapped at the end of an evening that had started well, with Rihanna and her then boyfriend, R&amp;amp;B star and kids&apos; favourite Chris Brown – who was 19 at the time – hanging out at a pre-Grammy awards party. Both were scheduled to appear at the awards ceremony the next evening, but it wasn&apos;t to be: when they left the party, Brown attacked Rihanna in their Lamborghini. Police documents alleged that a verbal argument led Brown to try, unsuccessfully, to force Rihanna out of the car. It was then claimed that he shoved her head against the car window, punched her repeatedly in the face, bit her left ear, bit her fingers and placed her&amp;nbsp;in a&amp;nbsp;headlock until she began to lose consciousness. Brown was charged with felony assault and making criminal threats; he reached a plea bargain by pleading guilty to the first charge and was sentenced in June to six months&apos; community labour and five years&apos; probation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The photograph of Rihanna should never have been made public – domestic violence victims are generally anonymous – but it was leaked to the gossip website TMZ.com. Here was a beautiful young woman who had recorded three successful albums in two years (her most recent, Good Girl Gone Bad, went multi-platinum), she was the first Barbadian to win a Grammy, had spent 10 weeks at number one in the UK with her irresistible 2007 hit Umbrella. There was shock at suddenly seeing her as a victim – her eyes were lowered, her skin swollen, there were welts to her forehead, bruising and marks to her mouth and cheeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The picture gave the lie to the stereotype of domestic violence victims as older, obviously downtrodden women. It showed, as Rihanna has&amp;nbsp;said herself, that this could &quot;happen to anyone&quot;. At the same time, it exposed the extent to which people still blame the victims of such attacks. A survey of 200 teenagers in Boston, for example, found that 46% thought that Rihanna was responsible for what had happened, while 52% said that both parties bore responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On her new album, Rated R, Rihanna plays with&amp;nbsp;this new public perception of her. The cover of the first single, Russian Roulette, for instance, shows her wrapped in barbed wire, while the video depicts her, variously, in a police cell, facing a man with a gun, abandoned on a road, and with blood seeping through her skin. Then there are the lyrics to the song Stupid In Love (&quot;My new nickname is you idiot... I still love you, but I just can&apos;t do this&quot;), and the photo shoot for the September issue of Italian Vogue in which she was pictured in a muzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robyn Rihanna Fenty was born in 1988, in Barbados; she has two younger bothers. She grew up in the parish of Saint Michael, &quot;in a slightly less than average neighbourhood&quot;, she shrugs – &quot;It wasn&apos;t the poorest, and it definitely wasn&apos;t the richest&quot; – and she always knew she wanted to sing. She would croon in the shower to her favourites: &quot;The divas,&quot; she sighs happily. &quot;Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, Shania Twain. I loved Luther Vandross. Still love him. And reggae was standard. You always listen to reggae in Barbados.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was determined to succeed, but there were no singing lessons to be had, no dancing lessons, and serious problems at home. Her father, Ronald, was a crack-cocaine addict who&amp;nbsp;was physically abusive to her mother, Monica. Since Rihanna describes her mother as&amp;nbsp;&quot;one of the strongest women I know, if not the&amp;nbsp;strongest&quot;, the abuse must have been&amp;nbsp;bewildering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there was the added psychological confusion of loving someone who was abusive. When she remembers the positive moments of her childhood, Rihanna says she always thinks &quot;about learning to swim, learning how to ride my bike, and it&apos;s funny, because most of these times were with my dad&quot;. But as she grew older, there was a time when she &quot;hated him. Then, one of my school friends, who I was very close to, she knew, and she always used to say, &apos;You can&apos;t hate your father&apos;, that you have to love him, at the end of the day, because he&apos;s your father. So I listened, as much as it took out of me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two of them were reconciled, until recently. &quot;I haven&apos;t been in touch with my dad&amp;nbsp;for&amp;nbsp;a year and a half, by his choice… He&amp;nbsp;came&amp;nbsp;on tour and acted a mess again, and we&amp;nbsp;sent him home, and after that he didn&apos;t answer my calls.&quot; She gives the small, rat-a-tat laugh that signals a&amp;nbsp;topic is closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she was eight or nine, Rihanna&apos;s parents separated and she was left looking after her youngest brother, Rajad. &quot;My mom was a single mom, so she worked a lot. She was really never home – I mean, she was home, but it would be after work, late at night, so I would take care of him. He was my best friend. He thought I was his mom!&quot; Rajad is 13 now. &quot;So cute… I don&apos;t think he&apos;ll ever be bad,&quot; she says, &quot;until he&apos;s, like, 19.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a child, Rihanna says, she &quot;was a nerd. Too&amp;nbsp;nerdy. I read all the time.&quot; But as she moved into her teens, her interest in school waned. At&amp;nbsp;lunchtimes she would sing with a couple of other girls – nothing serious – until one day one of&amp;nbsp;them set up an audition with a family friend, US songwriter and producer Evan Rogers, who was on holiday with his Barbadian wife. &quot;We sang as a group,&quot; says Rihanna, &quot;and then we sang individually, and Evan expressed an interest in helping me get a solo deal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I expect her to say that this was a brilliant moment, but her mouth turns down. &quot;It was a&amp;nbsp;really difficult place to be, because obviously I&amp;nbsp;didn&apos;t want to hurt my friend&apos;s feelings, I&amp;nbsp;didn&apos;t&amp;nbsp;want to betray her, but it was a reality. We&amp;nbsp;had auditioned together, and individually, and that was it.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 15, she began travelling between Barbados and the US in the school holidays to work on a&amp;nbsp;demo. At 16, her songs were taken to Jay-Z, then president of Def Jam Recordings, who immediately signed her up. Again, it should have been an exciting time – her first single, the summery, dancehall-tinged Pon De Replay, was a&amp;nbsp;sizeable hit – but nasty gossip took the shine off her success. &quot;It was like, &apos;Of course she had to give [Jay-Z] a blow job to get that deal.&apos; That rumour was everywhere in Barbados, and it was so disgusting, it made me feel really weird – I&amp;nbsp;would even be weird around Jay-Z. I wouldn&apos;t be&amp;nbsp;able to look him in the eye. One day, he called and he was like, &apos;Yo, you can&apos;t buy into these rumours, you can&apos;t let people move you with anything they say.&apos; The rumours started getting very funny to me after that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In those early days, Rihanna had a much softer image – in the Pon De Replay video, she dances around a nightclub in a crop top and baggy jeans, long hair floating around her shoulders. She obviously had a strong voice, and she could dance, too, but there wasn&apos;t that much to distinguish her from the other single-name starlets. There was also a sense of her life being out of her control. She talked of the strain of her schedule, the loneliness of spending night after night in hotel rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, in a year in which she&apos;s been portrayed as a victim, Rihanna actually seems happier and more in control now. &quot;Absolutely,&quot; she says, &quot;and I kind of had to fight for it. In the beginning it was almost like I was just going along with a script that was written for me, and I didn&apos;t feel like an artist, I felt like a tool. I just felt, hey, here I am, this money-making vehicle for this big record label [and] I&apos;m not even having fun, I&apos;m not enjoying it, because I&apos;m not able to be who I am… Then, finally, I said, &apos;You know what, if I want to do this, I&apos;m going to do it my way&apos; and I just rebelled, cut my hair, dyed it black, changed my image, changed my sound, and now we&apos;re still evolving because I&apos;m 21, I&apos;m still growing. I&apos;ve been through a lot in the last two years, especially&amp;nbsp;in the last year or so. It definitely forced me to do some growing up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We start talking obliquely about the assault. &quot;A&amp;nbsp;whole thing happened overnight this year,&quot; she says, &quot;the night before the biggest performance of my career, as well as 10 days before I became 21. It&amp;nbsp;was a turning point. It was the end of an incredible year, an incredible album [Good Girl Gone Bad], the beginning of&amp;nbsp;a new era, and it just felt like it was a&amp;nbsp;wake-up call&amp;nbsp;for me, and it had to happen. As&amp;nbsp;bad and as terrible as it was, there&apos;s&amp;nbsp;so much great that came out of&amp;nbsp;that situation.&quot; I must look surprised, but she continues. &quot;Even for him [I&amp;nbsp;assume she means Chris Brown], like, he knows now that he&apos;s never going to do that again. And now, young girls also, they learn from it, and I really hope young men can learn from it. Even more than the girls, the men really need to learn from it. Because everyone&apos;s focusing on the women, but the problem isn&apos;t the women.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rihanna spoke about the attack recently in an interview on US TV, discussing the fact that Brown was &quot;definitely my first big love&quot;, explaining that she briefly reconciled with him in the weeks after the assault, and then decided her actions were setting a bad example for young girls. &quot;I realised that my selfish decision for love could result in some girl getting killed,&quot; she said. &quot;I could not be easy with that part. I couldn&apos;t be held responsible for telling them, go back. Even if Chris never hit me again, who&apos;s to say that [their abusers] won&apos;t kill these girls?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would she ever use her experience to help others? She says yes, but &quot;I don&apos;t want that stamp going across my head as a victim of domestic violence.&quot; She pauses. &quot;As much as I was, that&apos;s a part of my life that I want to throw away, that I never want to go through again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ask how she felt about the leaking of the police photograph. &quot;It was a confidential case, by&amp;nbsp;law,&quot; she says, &quot;so when it became about getting a cheque, and completely disrespecting somebody else&apos;s privacy, it was just disappointing. I expect that from TMZ, but if the police can&apos;t protect you, then you can&apos;t be safe. You just feel completely exposed. And I was very disappointed,&quot; that word again, &quot;especially when I found out that it was [supposedly leaked by] women. Two women.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recently came up with a great phrase to describe her situation, saying that on the night of&amp;nbsp;the attack, she went to bed as Rihanna and woke up as Britney Spears. But if she&apos;s determined not to be cast as a victim, she still strives to take something positive from the publication of the photographs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Before, young girls would look at me, and they thought my life was perfect, but now they realise that it&apos;s not. Nobody&apos;s perfect. I&apos;m living the same human life that they are, just with a more public career – and when they realise that I do go through dumb stuff like that – all of a sudden that makes me human for them. So now I feel really strong, but I also feel very open.&quot; In a good way? She smiles widely. &quot;In a great way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• The album Rated R is out on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355710239|2009-11-25T21:07:12|c20277342b4dd8519383b82c1a7c9b5a651932de --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Monotonix, On tourGarage rock is a truly international language, spoken in the UK and Scandinavia, as well as the USA. To that list, we can now add Israel: with Monotonix, the country brings its own spin on this most basic way of making yourself understood. If Monotonix were guests in your home, you&apos;d be horrified. No respecters of personal space or private property, the band are hairy, sweaty and in your face, invading the crowd, shedding clothes, even drinking your drink. Truth be known, it&apos;s the only way to experience them. This tour is nominally to support album Where Were You When It Happened?, but it&apos;s less about fidelity to the recorded work than it is about the moment: Monotonix aren&apos;t promoting a product so much as their own bad selves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hectors House, Brighton, Wed; Scala, N1, Thu; CrawDaddy, Dublin, Fri &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Robinson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leonidas Kavakos, LondonGreek violinist Leonidas Kavakos has been described as a &quot;musician&apos;s musician&quot;, one of those performers who never draws attention to himself but is hugely respected within the profession. Though not as well known as some of his flashier colleagues, his reputation has steadily burgeoned since he won Helsinki&apos;s Sibelius competition in 1985, aged 18, so he now ranks among the world&apos;s leading violinists. The Southbank&apos;s current artist in focus, Kavakos appears as a soloist with the London Philharmonic in Berg&apos;s violin concerto (Wed); directing the Salzburg Camerata, for whom he was artistic director from 2007 until this autumn (28 Nov); playing sonatas with pianist Nicholas Angelich (29 Nov); and chamber music with Nikolai Lugansky, Gautier Capucon and Antoine Tamestit (1 Dec). An in-depth study of one of the most upwardly mobile musicians in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Wed to 1 Dec&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Clements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BLK JKS, Bristol, CardiffThough long thought an island unto itself, indie is waking up to a wider world. The tasteful guitar pop of Vampire Weekend is perhaps the most notable example, but Johannesburg&apos;s BLK JKS are also a band with an interesting take on things. Following in the offbeat traditions of groups such as Him and Extra Golden, they make more of the labyrinthine paths often followed by African guitarists than with their tunes, per se. The band&apos;s musical references range from very local traditions to far-flung climes like prog and math rock, making them less immediately enticing, more – to go on the evidence of album After Robots – a puzzle that takes time to unravel, but which may prove rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start The Bus, Bristol, Thu; Cardiff Arts Institute, Fri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Robinson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcus Miller, LondonReflecting on the great 1980s Miles Davis album, Tutu, the American guitarist Charlie Hunter told the Guardian that the session was &quot;a revelation, and another big hint that Miles was not the only genius involved in his band at that time&quot;. The other one was Marcus Miller, the astonishing electric bassist, composer, arranger and producer, who celebrates that recording on this final-day show of the London Jazz Festival. As an instrumentalist, Miller is a phenomenon, but this show involves more than bass pyrotechnics, because his Tutu music was some of the hippest and most atmospheric to have emerged from jazz-fusion, and a fitting late-life triumph for Miles Davis, whose role is taken here by rising American trumpet star Christian Scott.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barbican Hall, EC2, Sun&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Fordham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dream Of Gerontius, LondonThe period-instrument revolution has been moving forward for more than 30 years now. Its progress through the 17th and 18th centuries was relatively rapid, so that performances on modern instruments of much of the baroque and classical repertory are now very much the exception rather than the norm, and made quick inroads into the first half of the 19th century too. But further progress has been much more measured; though works by 1840s composers like Mendelssohn and Schumann get performed, music of the following generation – Brahms, Wagner and Bruckner – are still rarities, let alone later ones such as Mahler and Elgar. That makes this performance of Elgar&apos;s masterpiece The Dream Of Gerontius (which travels to Birmingham Town Hall next week) particularly fascinating. For Jeffrey Skidmore is conducting his choir Ex Cathedra and the Orchestra Of The Age Of Enlightenment, and it will be truly revelatory to hear Elgar&apos;s choral and orchestral textures more or less as he imagined them in terms of the instruments of his day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Festival Hall, SE1, Tue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Clements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jim Jones Revue, On tour&quot;Rock&apos;n&apos;roll is here to stay,&quot; was a pretty contentious statement when Danny And The Juniors made it in 1958; in 2009, when you can still go and see Chuck Berry in concert, it seems utterly prophetic. The Jim Jones Revue, supporting the notoriously irascible Berry on his current UK tour, are a young and living testament to the power of the music in its most revolutionary and testifying form, best heard on singles collection Here To Save Your Soul. Taking the rollicking piano riffs of Jerry Lee Lewis, the band reboot them with the chaotic passion of the MC5&apos;s Back In The USA and the sleazy abandon of the Birthday Party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liverpool Olympia, Sat; Journal Tyne Theatre, Newcastle upon Tyne, Sun; O2 Academy Glasgow, Mon; O2 Academy Leeds, Tue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Robinson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Since this issue of The Guide went to press, Chuck Berry postponed his UK tour until March 2010, resulting in the cancellation of the Jim Jones Revue dates listed above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355806719|2009-11-25T21:07:12|aa2e2a832e462287e4f99d744a7a656654c33e27 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;&quot;A record that will change your life,&quot; is a phrase that gets bandied about too often, but it&apos;s a cliche I can relate to. The first instance this happened was when I was sitting with my dad looking at the cover of the soundtrack LP to Disney&apos;s Fantasia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Who&apos;s that scary monster on the bottom of the LP, dad?&quot; I quivered, aged three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Well, Andrew, that&apos;s the devil. And he sleeps under your bed and if you do something bad you will go to hell and burn alive forever.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty years later, with the bedwetting pretty much in check, I found myself intrigued by the packaging of another record, which was in the style of a pharmaceutical product, complete with liner notes written on similar paper and in similar style to patient instructions. I was in the doctor&apos;s every week as a kid, and I associated the chemist with brilliant things like lying in bed all day gorging on cough medicine, watching TV, and not going to school. These memories were brought rushing back upon opening my favourite British rock record of the last 20 years, Ladies And Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space by Spiritualized, AKA Jason Pierce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time I&apos;d given up on Benylin in favour of a new drug called &quot;two bottles of white wine and three temazepam every night to dull the boredom of living in Southport&quot;. Ladies And Gentlemen was the perfect soundtrack to those dizzy nights, getting wasted in awful bars, having people throw tables at me, and falling asleep in bushes. The album sounded wild and romantic and dangerous and heartbreaking, which is how rock&apos;n&apos;roll should sound. It was one of the records that convinced me to move to London to pursue a career that would allow me to research two of its main themes (drugs and rock&apos;n&apos;roll) in detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the album&apos;s making, Pierce brought in the likes of Memphis legend Jim Dickinson and New Orleans voodoo pianist Dr John to turn his obsessions with old-fashioned music like gospel, garage and soul into a record that sounded like it was recorded on a spaceship. It beat Radiohead and the Verve&apos;s self-important, over-rated indie rock to the top of the NME&apos;s 1997 albums poll by mixing really loud songs about getting high with breathtakingly beautiful love songs and crazed free jazz episodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Articles about it never fail to mention how Jason Pierce denies that the sad songs were written about his break-up with musical collaborator and girlfriend Kate Radley. The main point about this angle is: &quot;Who cares about his personal life? Mine&apos;s much more important to me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a space-rock Ray Charles, Pierce is a master of making universal songs that make the listener think every line is about them. For anyone not as hopelessly addicted to Spiritualized as me, this record is the best place to start working on your habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355768720|2009-11-25T21:07:12|bca49e50448241e78193f3864329b1619880b14f --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;High Voltage, ManchesterA lucky few can turn their passion to profit, and though an inherent eagerness may cushion the ride, that doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s going to be an easy one. When Richard Cheetham&apos;s efforts with his High Voltage fanzine and club night brought him to the attention of Night And Day, he inherited promotion duties at one of Manchester&apos;s most industrious and toughest venues. The resultant task meant that 18 months ago, following their tiny venue party with MGMT, High Voltage&apos;s club night had to cease. Having recently departed Night And Day, Richard has made tentative efforts to return his brand to the forefront of the city&apos;s live music-centred club scene. His first proper showcase occurs this Friday, featuring live acts May68, the Heartbreaks, Strays, Hey Zeus and the Blackout Band – the pick of the local scene. Sex With Robots resident Oscar Wildstyle joins the High Voltage writers in manning the decks until 3am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Deaf Institute, Grosvenor Street, Fri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marc Rowlands&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sink The Pink, LondonEver thrown an epic house party and thought, &quot;Cor, I should totally do this for a living&quot;? A fair few people probably have, but most change their minds the morning after when they&apos;re cleaning up the 50th liquid ashtray tinnie. The folk from Sink The Pink, however, stuck to their guns and are now the proud, if somewhat accidental, owners of a monthly camptastic rave-up. A joyous mess of face paints, glitter, wigs and sticky sweeties, this is what happens when Studio 54 joins up with a toddler&apos;s birthday party in a suburban ballpool centre. Tonight sees a performance from Vula Malinga of Basement Jaxx as well as DJs Rod Thomas, SuDan Disco and Sam Potts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Resistance Gallery, E2, Sat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leonie Cooper&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funkbox, BirminghamThe self-proclaimed &quot;home of deep funk in Birmingham&quot;, Funkbox emerged from a group of lads&apos; shared love of classic funk played on dusty vinyl, and moved to the Hare And Hounds last year. Since then, they&apos;ve hosted some memorable shows at this handsomely converted pub-cum-venue situated three miles south of the city centre, with tonight&apos;s headliners being the eight-piece, LA phenomenon known as Breakestra. This virtuoso group&apos;s simple manifesto is to recreate the breaks and beats from classic soul cuts which went on to form the building blocks of hip-hop. The result is an intoxicating and unrelenting live funk groove topped with vocals from Afrodyete which firmly emphasise the &quot;fun&quot; in funk. Warming things up with a strong dose of trademark funk, soul and rare groove is the Funkbox DJ posse of RoyRoastbeef, Ritchie Re-Issue, Cro and Revo, plus Leftfoot resident Sam Redmore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hare &amp;amp; Hounds, High St, Kings Heath, Sat &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Mitchell&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guilty, EdinburghThanks to the success of Sean Rowley&apos;s London-based Guilty Pleasures, it&apos;s no longer a crime against culture and fashion to admit a fondness for the hair salon rock of Hall And Oates, or to be seen by one&apos;s peers to be whirling around a dancefloor with abandon to Wham! Even the Specials&apos; perpetually po-faced frontman Terry Hall enjoyed a stint behind the decks at KOKO, before the inevitable hen parties proved too much for his sensibilities. One among many of GPs&apos; sincerest flatterers is weekly Edinburgh club night known simply as Guilty. Their agenda is nevertheless transparent, as resident DJ Johnny Frenetic leads his punters through a cheese-scented tunnel of wall-to-wall tunes ranging from the woeful to the wonderful, spanning the past 50 years and zig-zagging across genres as diverse as classic hip-hop, indie rock and television theme tunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lulu, George Street, Wed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patric Baird&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hot Blood, LondonThe newest project from the Lovebox stable, this is a dance night with a purpose. Ready to take on everything from disco and dub to funk and house, Hot Blood makes like the nicest school bully you&apos;ve ever encountered, picking on one thing and one thing only – be it a country, label, artist or album – for the entire course of the night. This month it&apos;s outsider musician Arthur Russell, and alongside label Electric Minds, Lovebox will be dedicating the evening to the cello brandishing cult icon. A screening of documentary Wild Combination will be introduced by Tim Lawrence, who also reads from his forthcoming Russell biography. Serving as a launch party for Go Bang: A Tribute To Arthur Russell, bands and DJs featured on the record will be performing, including My Tiger My Timing, Yam Who? and Faze Action, as well as Maurice Fulton, Killer Whale and Groove Armada&apos;s Tom Findlay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relentless Garage, N5, Fri&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leonie Cooper&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355767224|2009-11-25T21:07:12|41cc0ce92c0f96cde7cf797e60a7083c99de7424 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Snapshot: Mean and moody on holidayMy sister (seated, 17) and me (standing, 14), mean and moody under the magnificent ramparts of Bamburgh castle in the last week of July 1981. I love this photo because it is so very early 80s and so very truthful. It may remind you of the photo on the cover of your favourite synth duo&apos;s debut single, but it&apos;s just us on holiday having finally consented to have our photo taken. My sulky look pretty much sums up my teenage demeanour: churn up the Tears for Fears album The Hurting with Private Fraser&apos;s &quot;We&apos;re doomed, all doomed&quot; off Dad&apos;s Army. To me, there was a lot to be troubled about in the early 80s, from Mutually Assured Destruction downwards. Do you remember that the government distributed leaflets with hints and tips on surviving a nuclear strike? I don&apos;t know why my sister is looking miserable, though she had left a social life and a boyfriend at home for a week. Did my mum and dad enjoy themselves? I don&apos;t know, but I imagine not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were on our family holiday in the week of Lady Di and Prince Charles&apos;s wedding, swapping our home in suburban Surrey for an isolated cottage in the Borders. It had unreliable television reception, so while everyone else in Britain would be watching the nuptials, we probably wouldn&apos;t. No, I wasn&apos;t really bothered about the wedding, but yes, it was the ideal opportunity to make my parents feel bad. My other memories of the holiday sort of sum it up: visiting Edinburgh on the Sunday, in an era when the city was closed on a Sunday; not one but two trips to Galashiels so my mum could buy a fluffy pastel designer jumper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A photo from earlier in the day captures Sarah and me laughing during&amp;nbsp;a boat trip to the Farne islands. The isolated cottage now sounds like a pretty dreamy holiday location, the fluffy jumper was by a &quot;visionary textile designer&quot;, the world stepped back from the brink of nuclear annihilation; and I&apos;d like to thank my mum and dad for their courage in recording our teen spirit. But not everything changes – as if in unconscious tribute to our mean, moody and magnificent teenage selves,&amp;nbsp;my sister and I still do not guarantee smiles in family photos. Helen Fisher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playlist: Mum jiving in the kitchenI Saw Her Standing There by the Beatles &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;She wouldn&apos;t dance with another/When I saw her standing there&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can&apos;t listen to this song without seeing Mum&apos;s joy as she stops what she&apos;s doing in the kitchen and grabs my hand, swinging my arms around in a jive, weaving and twisting us about. I don&apos;t think she could ever be still or silent when she heard it or any of the Beatles&apos; songs. I&apos;ve still got her record case from her teenage years in the 60s, on which she had faked John, Paul, George and Ringo&apos;s autographs. Paul was the best – or sometimes John.  (A bit like her &quot;Paul Newman or Robert Redford?&quot; dilemma.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kitchen was the first one we&apos;d had that was just about big enough to dance in. It was the 80s but it still had the original larder with a stone slab, which she had painted blood red (nothing to do with joints of meat, as we had been a vegetarian family since the 70s – she had created her own veggie burgers long before you could buy them anywhere). She became ill in her late 40s. Dementia is a blurry illness so it&apos;s hard to say when exactly it crept&amp;nbsp;in, but soon afterwards she wasn&apos;t able look after herself. A year after her funeral on a blowy sunny October afternoon, my sister, brothers and I scattered her ashes on the Sussex coast. I didn&apos;t cry. I felt lucky to be with&amp;nbsp;the others, their partners, and mine who carried our baby son&apos;s pram over the stones. It was in the Little Chef on the way home&amp;nbsp;while When I Saw Her Standing There was playing that my eyes welled&amp;nbsp;up as I sang to the baby. We&amp;nbsp;found out I was pregnant a week after Mum died. &quot;Your turn to dance in&amp;nbsp;the kitchen, kid.&quot; Baby seems to like&amp;nbsp;it at the moment. I wonder how long before he minds? Trudi Cowper &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We love to eat: Father&apos;s &apos;breaddies&apos;Ingredients (makes a 1.5lb/700g loaf)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 cup warm water&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 tbsp butter &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 cups all-purpose flour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 tsp salt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 tsp sugar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 tsp dried yeast or fresh yeast&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frying pan with hot oil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mix ingredients together, then tear off small chunks to fry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mother and father had seven children in 10 years and then me six years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, they had a television and no, they weren&apos;t staunch Catholics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, I am close to every one of my siblings, but the one thing that acts as a subtle reminder of this age gap is the fact that I missed out on the delicacy of &quot;breaddies&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, Mother and Father&amp;nbsp;would bake at least two fresh loaves of bread each morning to satisfy seven hungry mouths. Sometimes, however, demand surpassed supply and the dough wouldn&apos;t have risen in time. In such emergencies, Father would tear small bits from the heaving white mass and plop into a frying pan, producing round golden cakes of bread loveliness, which imaginatively were given the name breaddies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To this day, just the very mention of the word breaddie sends my older siblings into a food-besotted trance. They pause for a second and a fond, nostalgic look comes into their eyes – apparently breaddies were the tastiest things on earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by the time I came along, so had sliced bread for some reason, and I never had the pleasure of trying my father&apos;s breaddies to see what all the fuss was about. Sadly I won&apos;t ever now, as he passed away almost 10 years ago when I was 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I&apos;ll cope without a breaddie – I mean, I could make my own if I wanted. But whether I&apos;ll cope without my father on the other hand … well now, that depends what you mean by the word &quot;cope&quot;.

It&apos;s at an old people&apos;s home and there&apos;ll be only 30 there. Or 29, if nice Mr Briggs doesn&apos;t make it through the next 24 hours.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sounds more like it. They won&apos;t be all pissed and rowdy, will they?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Nah – they&apos;re given their meds at 6.30pm, so they&apos;ll be good as gold.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I still want a rider in the contract. Just in case. Anyone caught bringing Horlicks into the gig gets slung out. We don&apos;t want them spilling it or throwing it at me, do we?

We don&apos;t want to miss Corrie. Why&amp;nbsp;don&apos;t you join us?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What a great idea,&quot; I say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today Eastbourne, tomorrow Torquay Crematorium.

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are copious strings to 50 Cent&apos;s platinum bow. As well as being a rapper, self-help guru and inspiration to many, he&apos;s an actor and videogame voiceover artiste. Recently added to that list is &quot;short film auteur&quot;. Before I Self Destruct is a semi-autobiographical tale of murder and revenge – with added lesbian sex scenes – which will be included with Fiddy&apos;s forthcoming album of the same name, creating a whole new genre: straight to CD. Here&apos;s how to make your own ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHEN TO DO ITThere comes a point in the career trajectory of major pop stars when the people employed to say &quot;no&quot; to things become surplus to requirements. Without them, ill-advised concept albums are recorded, strange product endorsements are accepted, or, in extreme cases, diamond-encrusted necklaces shaped like a weeping Virgin Mary are worn to display your love of religion. It&apos;s at this point that the music video format becomes too stifling, too de rigueur. It&apos;s now that they need at least 15 minutes to fully display the true core of their creativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO WILL DIRECT IT?Hiring a visionary to translate the garbled mess of your dreams into a coherent &quot;mini movie&quot; is a must. Michael Jackson – surely the overlord of the extended video concept – roped in John Landis for Thriller, then switched to Martin Scorsese for Bad.The scourge of young country singers everywhere, AKA Kanye West, recently released the Spike Jonze-directed We Were Once A Fairytale. Sometimes, however, no one can be trusted; 50 Cent directed, wrote and starred in Before I Self Destruct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DON&apos;T HIDE YOUR ASPIRATIONSFilm references are often plundered as if to say, &quot;I&apos;m versatile and desperately trying to get into acting.&quot; Specimen A: the &quot;female James Bond&quot; embarrassment of Mariah Carey&apos;s Honey. Specimen B: Meat Loaf&apos;s eight-minute mini epic, I&apos;d Do Anything For Love, directed with beautiful understatement by Michael Bay, a smörgåsbord of filmic references, centred around Beauty &amp;amp; The Beast, and in no way an excuse for the facially challenged Meat Loaf to cop off with a young lady encumbered only by a floaty cotton dress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF YOURSELF AWAYWest&apos;s We Were Once A Fairytale starts out like a typical night in the life of a superstar, with Kanye drinking in a club and seducing a lady friend before discovering he is actually getting amorous with some soft furnishings. The second act sees him carve a rodent out of his hand before it commits suicide. We&apos;re assuming it&apos;s a comment about the pressures and loneliness of fame. Michael Jackson&apos;s 40-minute-long Ghosts is easier to decipher; creepy, shadowy figure feels ostracised from society so builds his own version of Xanadu until some kids arrive to hound him out but learn to love him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REMEMBER YOUR MANNERSNote to Kanye; rushing the stage at the Oscars when your acting debut proper fails to bag you an award will not be accepted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355871043|2009-11-25T21:07:12|c322aa130d9d2f98c0c5cde8437ff4d4e25b59d4 --&gt;</body>

      <standfirst>There&apos;s no The Queen Is Dead or Prince Charming but there is Power, Corruption &amp;amp; Lies. Launching in January, Royal Mail&apos;s new collection of stamps will celebrate 10 classic British album sleeves across genres and decades. As well as the artwork pictured above, there&apos;ll be Blur&apos;s Parklife, Led Zeppelin IV, David Bowie&apos;s The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust, Pink Floyd&apos;s The Division Bell, Mike Oldfield&apos;s Tubular Bells and Coldplay&apos;s A Rush Of Blood To The Head. The stamps were designed by London&apos;s Studio Dempsey and the 10 were chosen by Royal Mail in conjunction with various UK music magazines and designers.

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;When is a record not a record? When it is a souvenir of a phenomenon. Weeks ahead of release, Susan Boyle&apos;s debut album has topped Amazon&apos;s pre-sale charts. Boyle is the church mouse who roared on Britain&apos;s Got Talent last spring, turning the tables on judges and audience members disdainful that a woman over 25 blithe to the rigours of Botox should open her mouth in public. A viral pandemic on YouTube made the Scottish fortysomething an international star. This is her dream come true, we are told; never mind that the whirlwind taking her from West Lothian to happy ever after has already landed this psychologically delicate woman in the Priory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, then, is no mere bunch of songs; it is a commemorative mug of a major national event, rendered as a silver gewgaw that plays music. It would be instructive to see a Venn diagram showing the overlap between purchasers of I Dreamed a Dream and those buying Lady Gaga&apos;s album, The Fame Monster. Or, indeed, the overlap between SuBo and any other record at all. Just for a moment, let&apos;s pretend this is a CD. Boyle&apos;s signature tune, &quot;I Dreamed a Dream&quot;, is largely unaltered from her rendition on Britain&apos;s Got Talent, as is &quot;Cry Me a River&quot;. That great standard of the Christian tradition, &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, ably anchors the mid-section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain&apos;s favourite hymn, &quot;How Great Thou Art&quot;, comes straight out of Songs of Praise, and the prize ring of a Christmas No 1 is clinched by &quot;Silent Night&quot;. In a world where Leona Lewis does Snow Patrol, curveball covers are no surprise, but Boyle&apos;s spartan version of the Rolling Stones&apos; &quot;Wild Horses&quot; is no travesty. Gospel-tinged and shivery, &quot;Up to the Mountain&quot; is a bigger shock. Patty Griffin&apos;s original alludes to Martin Luther King. You suspect Boyle got it from Simon Cowell, who heard Kelly Clarkson do it on American Idol. The very best thing about I Dreamed a Dream is that Boyle is mercifully restrained throughout. A little vibrato is as close as she comes to over-emoting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more fitting end to Britain&apos;s Got Talent would have seen Boyle kebabbing the judges and burning down the whole cruel, exploitative edifice with her telekinetic powers, like Stephen King&apos;s Carrie. As it is, you can only hope that her success will make Susan Boyle happy and that the fame monster doesn&apos;t eat her up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355741921|2009-11-25T21:07:12|7879a95ece34e8c6ea70ab8f62243a29a4087666 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;MySpace has settled a year-long row with independent record companies with a landmark deal that will allow artists including Arctic Monkeys, Radiohead and Vampire Weekend to sell tracks on the social networking site&apos;s music service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MySpace Music launched in the US last year, recently expanded into Australia and New Zealand and plans to roll out in the UK soon. But the launch of the service was marred by anger from the largest independent record labels, which accused News Corp-owned MySpace of leaving them out in the cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four majors that signed up to the new service – Sony, Universal, Warner and EMI – all received an equity stake in the venture. But Merlin, an agency representing independents around the world, complained the smaller labels were not offered comparable terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other artists represented by Merlin&apos;s member labels include Adele, Basement Jaxx, Tom Waits, Franz Ferdinand and Prodigy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now independent labels representing 10% of the global music market will join MySpace Music, creating one of the largest independent music offerings on the web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two sides said in a joint statement that a new deal would allow Merlin&apos;s members to &quot;participate in and benefit from the financial growth of MySpace Music&quot;. The agreement is to be announced formally on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They declined to disclose the commercial terms but said Merlin&apos;s member labels would be eligible to make money from their content on MySpace Music and that a Merlin nominee had been invited to attend and participate in selected MySpace Music board meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;We can now provide our users with access to the rich catalogue that Merlin brings while simultaneously enabling Merlin labels to monetise their content within the MySpace community and easily track their fan engagement via our artist dashboard,&quot; said Courtney Holt, the president of MySpace Music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The row between the independents and MySpace was particularly striking given the social&apos;s network&apos;s reputation as a place to discover new music. But Holt sought to stress a spirit of co-operation between the two sides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;MySpace Music values the support of the independent community and it has been a top priority for us to create a programme that would reward their steadfast support of the service,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Merlin chief executive, Charles Caldas, said the new deal would give MySpace Music the support of independent labels. &quot;The creation of this participation plan, along with the ability for Merlin nominees to participate in MySpace Music board meetings, shows that MySpace Music has recognised the value Merlin offers,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MySpace Music users could already stream music from many of the independent music label artists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355892539|2009-11-25T21:07:12|3dbde5d947eaf24758d92937fa707a2dcf71fd7c --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I feel like a motherless child. Particularly when my mum is on the phone telling me off for not remembering my aunt&apos;s birthday. Fortunately, that only happens once a year, the rest of the time my mother and I are very close. Too close, some might say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B that as it may ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buff Saint Marie – Bury My Heart at Wounded KneeHave to say I was greatly swayed by Sonofwebcore&apos;s nom because musically I don&apos;t think this song is so interesting. Lyrically, however, it is excoriating, the fourth verse in particular. Everyone should listen and the book is worth your time too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nina Simone – The Ballad of Hollis Brown This is Dylan&apos;s song and his version relays a tragic tale with a discomfiting iciness. But Simone raises the tempo and emotes a bit more, and I like it for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Waits – 9th and Hennepin Like Philip Marlowe standing on the corner of a George Grosz painting. Just a little off-kilter, and thoroughly bleak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elliott Smith – King&apos;s CrossingA miserable, cynical offering clad in a sugary, harmonic coating. &quot;It don&apos;t matter because I have no sex life/All I want to do now is inject my ex-wife&quot; – there&apos;s a certain desperation about this, that&apos;s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Animals – We Gotta Get Out of This Place A good rollicking tune, for which I am thankful among all the morbidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grandmaster Flash – The Message This is the Gremlin FC memorial selection. It sounds slightly innocent now after 20 years of keeping it real, but it&apos;s still a classic and definitely fits the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phil Collins – The Roof is Leaking Yes, Phil Collins. It&apos;s a not entirely convincing tale of rural misery and imminent destitution, but ... it has a wonderful chorus, with a thoroughly unexpected and equally welcome banjo break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dionne Warwick – I Just Don&apos;t Know What to Do With Myself The most elegant and graceful desperation imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radiohead – Karma Police  One of those songs that&apos;s probably better saved for another topic, but there are hints of a crazed desperation among the paranoia, and that cataclysmic conclusion too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Clapton – Layla Will probably make the A-list for songs suited to walloping a Mondeo down the M40, but it&apos;s a cracker and with more of a groove than I remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, coming of age songs. We&apos;ve had songs about adolescence, but while that can sometimes chime with a moment where a boy or girl becomes a man or woman, it doesn&apos;t always. Should bring up some good storytelling, but if you wanted to get all pop critic, you could nominate songs where a band finds their voice. As ever, I will be on the blog on Friday if you want to ask me questions or you can email me at the Guardian address as a couple of you did this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN OTHER NEWS: next week I am away, Rob Fitzpatrick will be covering, but the theme will coincide with the climate summit in Copenhagen. Specifically what (we&apos;ve had songs about the environment) is yet to be decided, but I&apos;m opening it up for suggestions – Rob will pick a winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rulebook:DO NOT post more than a third of the lyrics to any one song.DO Post your nominations before midday on Monday if you wish them to be considered.DO Post justifications of your choices wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The toolbox: Full archive and latest column, the Marconium, the Spill, the Collabo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355822898|2009-11-25T21:07:12|01bc7ca6bd37c61ef41b58f9b1bc3c245ba24552 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;No matter how many provocative Annie Leibowitz shots Miley Cyrus poses for, as long as her sole professional association is with Disney TV and its record label, she&apos;ll always find it hard to convince those past puberty that there&apos;s much more to her than concentrated gosh-darned-shucks wholesomeness. She is wholesome, that much is undeniable, but she has her name on plenty of inventive, imaginative and precisely calibrated examples of modern chart pop, songs that would have been noticed beyond her audience of young girls had they come from a more credible source. This mini-album opens with one such, Kicking and Screaming, a declamatory techno-rock exercise of the sort that characterised Girls Aloud&apos;s golden period. Party in the USA is a cute pop song, with a clever clash between feathery jazz guitar chords and a booming synth bassline serving as hook. But it&apos;s downhill from there, thanks to a run of inferior ballads arrested only at the very close by one rather superior ballad, The Climb - but that&apos;s been bussed in from the Hannah Montana movie soundtrack to add some ballast since this collection&apos;s US release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355812654|2009-11-25T21:07:12|e235690bc275488ed44214771ddd7000b1e2610e --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;A heartwarming story in the Independent today: Elgar was a rubbish trombonist. Sue Addison, the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment&apos;s principal &apos;bone player, has been researching the story of Sir Edward&apos;s trombone before she plays the instrument in public for first time since the composer&apos;s death in 1934, in a performance next week of The Dream of Gerontius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not that Elgar himself could ever have mastered his own trombone parts: contrary to popular belief – OK, &quot;popular&quot; in Elgar-scholarship circles, at least – Elgar took up the instrument as a young boy, and was thought to have been a half-decent player. Not so, according to Addison. He did not actually take up learning the trombone until he was in his mid-40s – and he never mastered how to play the blasted thing properly. Addison has unearthed a letter from Dora Penny (Elgar&apos;s close friend, immortalised as Variation 10 of the Enigma Variations), who stayed with Elgar and overheard him practising. Dora reveals the real story of Elgar&apos;s instrumental ineptitude, quoted in the Indy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;On one occasion, he [Elgar] got up and fetched a trombone that was standing in a corner and began trying to play passages in the score. He didn&apos;t do very well and often played a note higher or lower than the one he wanted... and as he swore every time that happened, I got into such a state of hysterics that I didn&apos;t know what to do. Then he turned to me [and said]: &apos;How do you expect me to play this dodgasted thing if you laugh?&apos; I went out of the room as quickly as I could and sat on the stairs, clinging to the banisters &apos;til the pain eased but it was no good. I couldn&apos;t stop there as he went on making comic noises, so I went downstairs out of earshot for a bit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s just as well for Dora and the rest of his trombone-suffering friends that Elgar did the decent thing, in 1918, and donated his dodgasted instrument to the YMCA in Worcester, to be given as a morale boosting fillip to troops on the front line (it later turned up in 1934, the year of Elgar&apos;s death, in the Ealing YMCA). It&apos;s also reassuring for us fellow incompetent instrumentalists when we&apos;re hacking away at our pianos, cellos and french horns, offending our neighbours with our own &quot;comic noises&quot;, to know that we&apos;re in good company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355851494|2009-11-25T21:07:12|088cd0e0ea7388b9e47c3ecf7318388de24a1808 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Interpol are &quot;falling back towards&quot; their debut, drummer Sam Fogarino said this week, drawing inspiration for their fourth album from the same stuff that animated their first. The band plans to release the record in early 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpol&apos;s most celebrated album is 2002&apos;s Turn On the Bright Lights. Alternately hailed and mocked for its debt to Joy Division, the group made beautiful new music out of gloomy nostalgia. Since then, they have tried to edge away from this sound – adding keyboards and, er, &quot;stadium-rock cliches&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, however, may be over. &quot;The new record falls back towards the first,&quot; Fogarino told Paste magazine. &quot;In trying to move forward, there was an unspoken realisation that you can&apos;t let go of your sonic-defining tag. There was an effort in Daniel [Kessler]&apos;s guitar tone; he rediscovered it playing in his loft for a year without anybody. The quality of that tone, played in a big room, is just beautiful. It creates an atmosphere.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;That big wash of reverb? It&apos;s back,&quot; he underlined. &quot;It&apos;s there. I personally brought two reverb tanks to the studio that our engineer fell in love with.&quot; Fogarino admitted that 2007&apos;s Our Love to Admire was not the group&apos;s best work. &quot;[It wasn&apos;t] our most cohesive moment. It was when reality kicked in as to where we were and where we were never going back to.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpol began recording earlier this year at New York&apos;s Electric Lady studios, but Fogarino said it  was a lengthy process. &quot;You&apos;ll begrudge it, but you know that each person&apos;s opinion is another form of quality control. And when we all agree, it&apos;s ready for someone to hear.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355846151|2009-11-25T21:07:12|8d4f523be6bd97c3d7073613f24a495050fd5343 --&gt;</body>

        <show-notes> Welcome, one and all, to the latest edition of Music Weekly. This week&apos;s show kicks off with art beast Gonzales, who happens to be in the middle of a residency at London&apos;s Pigalle club. Laura Barton met up with the Canadian musician to talk about being &quot;welcomed into the bosom of the French&quot;, trying to blend musical genius with entertainment and why having Jarvis Cocker on speed dial helps get more people to come to your shows. Barton even manages to squeeze in a piano lesson with the man who holds the record for the longest ever solo performance (27 hours, since you ask).  Singles Club rumbles into action with Paul MacInnes, Rosie Swash and Will Dean. On the menu this week is the latest band to take on the Afro-pop mantle, Fool&apos;s Gold, and their single Ha Dvash. We also review an unlikely appearance from So Solid (who&apos;ve dropped the Crew) and their comeback track, Since You Went Away, and cast our ears over the latest in a long line of &quot;hotly tipped&quot; new bands, the Drums.  There is, of course, more. Manchester-based arty post-punkers Everything Everything meet up with Paul MacInnes to vent their distaste at Kasabian&apos;s inter-song changeability and share their love for R Kelly, among other things.   As if that wasn&apos;t enough, Observer Music Monthly&apos;s Gareth Grundy salutes the talents of Liverpudlian quartet Shack in The Feature With No Name.  So there you have it, this week&apos;s show. Befriend us on Facebook if you wish, and please let us know what you think of the interviews, the music and the show. </show-notes>

      <type-specific class="article">
        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Composer Mike Gibbs&apos;s festival appearance surely made him part of the week&apos;s most unusual trio. There was guitarist Bill Frisell, drummer Joey Baron and Gibbs himself, represented by the massed ranks of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. In Collage for a Day, a much-anticipated festival highlight, Gibbs created a sumptuous yet flexible orchestral setting for some of Frisell&apos;s classic themes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purr of the orchestra&apos;s strings softened and even romanticised the guitarist&apos;s trademark harmonically twisted country chords and jaunty rockabilly dances. But the graceful balance of order and open jamming in Gibbs&apos;s orchestral score let most of this unique artist&apos;s character glow through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jubilant hoedowns and wise melodies of Aaron Copland&apos;s Appalachian Spring and Charles  Ives&apos;s Three Places in New England dominated the first half. Then Frisell began threading his offhand bluesy asides through gently billowing  strings, swapping call-and-response phrases with a solo cello, then unleashed a distorted, slowly rocking theme underpinned by stately tuba descents and booming tymps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A guitar vamp driven by an ecstatic Baron was resolved in a riff for a group of fiddles and violas – and if the brass fanfares of Gibbs&apos;s classic theme Sweet Rain taxed the trumpets, its fragile melody was poignantly explored by Frisell. Country dances, dark reveries and an almost Benny Goodman-like swinger brought the show to an  encore on Beautiful Dreamer, the guitar singing softly over a brooding and almost sinister arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the week, a shoebox  space in a Kentish Town pub represented the kind of heartening contrast the London Jazz festival always offers. The Gibbs-influenced pianist/composer Hans Koller had led a classy big band there on Tuesday, with the room rammed following rumours that Frisell was going to sit in. He didn&apos;t, but the music&apos;s quirky harmonies represented him admirably – as did  a crop of classy soloists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadcast on Radio 3  on Tuesday. The London jazz festival ends  tomorrow.

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hometown: Swindon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lineup: Disco (drums), Philonious Funk aka Chilly (decks), Bozo (lyricist), Bully (vocals).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The background: Beatbullyz sounds like a terrible attempt on the part of the BBC to find an evocative &quot;urban&quot; name for an anti-bullying campaign that speaks to kids. Not that there&apos;s anything wrong with that as an initiative, but it&apos;s probably not the coolest way to announce yourselves as a pop group, and the &quot;z&quot; doesn&apos;t help (see also: N-Dubz). In fact, quite a lot about Beatbullyz doesn&apos;t appeal on paper. There are those aliases for starters – Bully and Bozo in particular are virtually asking for a critical kicking with theirs. Then there are the raps on their songs, which sometimes appear to have been added as an afterthought, presumably to give their melodic R&amp;amp;B pop an inner-city edge. Some of those platitudinous lyrics have got to go: &quot;The best things in life are free.&quot; Are they? Have you not driven a Lamborghini Murcielago? And they seem to have learned everything there is to know about scratching from whatever is the turntablist equivalent of the Bert Weedon Play in a Day guitar handbook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet there&apos;s something about their music that appeals. Bully doesn&apos;t just have a singsong voice that&apos;s easy on the ear and works within the context of their tunes, he&apos;s also the producer who manages to give the music some of the epic lavishness that Trevor Horn brought to the latest Robbie Williams album. Actually, Pieces – the first track on this as yet unsigned band&apos;s MySpace – is a bit of a Robbie-ish ballad, while the subject matter, karmic retribution, would suit the UFO-obsessed Williams. Golden City, the new single, is a fine piece of symphonic dance-pop with a lovely melody and a memorable piano line, and in this instance the rap feels integrated rather than dropped in from a great height – it reminds us a bit of the &quot;hip house&quot; blink-and-you&apos;d-miss-it movement of the late 80s. Starlight is a hip-hop ballad with a positivist message about hope and self-improvement – yuk, right? – but once again it is better than that sounds. Best Things is another mournful one, Bully almost crooning over the minor-chord melody, while Keys to Life is the one they&apos;ve been invited to perform on Channel 4&apos;s Hollyoaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although still deal-less, there is considerable major-label interest in the quartet, who got a massive reaction at this year&apos;s Radio 1 Weekend and regularly fill 700-capacity venues in their hometown. We&apos;re not sure what it is they do – is it hip-hop? R&amp;amp;B? Soul? Ska-inflected funk-pop? – but there&apos;s a slickness here and an accomplished quality that makes easy categorisation unnecessary. They might only have one successful season in them as Just Jack-style chirpy rap-popsters or, depending on what direction they take and who they choose to collaborate with in future (they&apos;ve already earmarked Dizzee, Chase &amp;amp; Status and Shingai from the Noisettes as potential musical partners), they could end up being the UK answer to Black Eyed Peas. Letz see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The buzz: &quot;The quality of the songwriting and optimistic, melodic sunny-day styles have to be heard to be believed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth: Try and get past that &quot;z&quot; – this is a pop alphabet soup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most likely to: Buy Lamborghini Murcielagos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Least likely to: Increase Swindon&apos;s pregnancy rate – they&apos;re always on tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What to buy: The single Golden City is released on 23 November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;File next to: Just Jack, Example, Black Eyed Peas, N-Dubz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links: myspace.com/beatbullyz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monday&apos;s new band: Rox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355866029|2009-11-25T21:07:12|59eda6ee3e018b5bfe54b0f616c119ada94f2cca --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week I was talking about LA, this week it&apos;s Notting Hill. My glamorous press trips are getting closer to home, so next week&apos;s Sleeve Notes special will be live from the Sainsbury&apos;s car park on Dalston Lane. Anyway, my reason for heading to Notting Hill was to retrace the story of punk, through the eyes of those who were around to witness it. Notting Hill might now be Tory party HQ, but back in the mid 70s it was a vibrant mix of Caribbean immigrants and outsider kids. This helped the area become the birthing ground for bands like the Clash and the Slits, as well as legendary record label Rough Trade. Founder Geoff Travis recalled selling reggae records to the local punk community, while elsewhere Don Letts recalled hanging out with the Clash at the Notting Hill riots. I also went in a search of new music charity Strummerville and stopped for a chinwag with punk expert and Guardian.co.uk/music blogger Jon Savage, who explained why it&apos;s never a good idea to bring heroin to a party (as Johnny Thunders did at a Christmas bash attended by the Sex Pistols). Of course, if you want more Savage then head to the music blog where he&apos;s just posted a dissection of the Shy FX jungle landmark, Sound of the Beast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five things we learned this weekThere&apos;s more to Cheryl Cole&apos;s naked shoulder than meets the eye&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes three to feud &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Velvet Underground are back together! (Er, sort of …) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Girls like to go Gaga&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how bad it gets, music can still get a whole lot worse &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes a good &apos;toilet track&apos;?Every amateur DJ knows how it feels to be stranded on the decks when nature calls. So what do you do? You&apos;d barely make it to the gents by the time the average pop hit was winding up, which means searching for something a little more &quot;creative&quot; (ie. longer, without getting monotonous). You lot suggested many fine tracks – the Doors&apos; LA Woman, for instance, or Kraftwerk&apos;s Autobahn. And yes, we know you can just put your iPod on shuffle these days, but we like to beatmatch and only use vinyl (honest). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest buzz graph placings are out!Loved by pop fans. Hated by pop stars (this week Little Boots tweeted that our we had turned her into a racehorse). It&apos;s the graph that keeps on giving. But where will the tips for 2009 end up? There&apos;s only two months left, so stay tuned ... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the hell is ... hockey rock? Is there anything stranger than old punk bands releasing albums dedicated to the joy of smacking a puck around an ice rink? Read our latest Scene and Heard blogpost and you&apos;ll find that, yes, actually there is ... it&apos;s Leeds punk bands making records about cricket (seriously).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And finally ... get following us on da Twitter .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355846483|2009-11-25T21:07:12|566b98d4c934fc2ed4bc449a12809b4111b6c035 --&gt;</body>

US federal agents raided a Gibson factory on Tuesday, claiming that they may have used illegal rosewood to make their guitars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Fish and Wildlife Service seized wood, computers, files and guitars from Gibson&apos;s Massman Road manufacturing facility in Nashville, Tennessee. They are seeking evidence that Gibson shipped illegal rosewood from Madagascar via Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosewood is expensive – more than double the cost of mahogany – and a crucial component in many guitars. Even at £3,000 per cubic metre, it can be found in acoustic guitar bodies and fingerboards. The troubled east African island of Madagascar, is a prime exporter of the hardwood. But due to corruption and environmental issues, Madagascan rosewood is a dubious proposition, and America&apos;s Lacey Act bars firms from bringing it into the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gibson promised that they are &quot;fully co-operating&quot; with the federal investigation. &quot;Gibson is a chain of custody certified buyers that purchases wood from legal suppliers who are to follow all standards,&quot; the company said.

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ringo Starr&apos;s forthcoming solo album will feature bass and backing vocals from an old, mop-topped pal from Liverpool. Paul McCartney appears on two tracks on Y Not, Starr&apos;s fifteenth solo record and the first he has produced himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Paul was doing the Grammys, so he came over to the house and was playing bass on [new song] Peace Dream,&quot; Starr explained. &quot;I played him this other track and Paul said, &apos;Give me the headphones. Give me a pair of cans&apos;. And he went to the mic and he just invented that part where he follows on my vocal. That was all Paul McCartney, and there could be nothing better.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The song, Walk With Me, was co-written by Starr and Van Dyke Parks, the 66-year-old arranger who has worked with everyone from the Beach Boys to Joanna Newsom. McCartney&apos;s vocals &quot;make it bigger and ... fuller&quot;, Starr said. &quot;It makes the song like a conversation between us, and that was Paul&apos;s idea to do his part one beat behind me. That&apos;s why he&apos;s a gen-i-us and an incredible bass player.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McCartney last teamed up with Starr for his 1998 album, Vertical Man, which also featured George Harrison and George Martin. More recently, they appeared together at a transcendental meditation benefit in New York earlier this year. Besides the former Beatle, Y Not&apos;s other &quot;gen-i-uses&quot; include Joss Stone, Ben Harper, All Starr bandmate Richard Marx and Ringo&apos;s brother-in-law, Joe Walsh. Still, the Fab Four drummer hasn&apos;t turned this into a grotesque comedy of cameos. Starr runs the show, also making his debut as producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I was the least involved in the production of the Beatles&apos; records. And then [the same] with my solo records,&quot; he said. &quot;Then suddenly it&apos;s another point in your life, and you say, &apos;I&apos;m going to do this now&apos;. So I&apos;ll be producing everything I make from now on. That&apos;s the good news. It&apos;s a confidence thing, I suppose. And Y Not is really another way of me saying, &apos;Yes I Can.&apos;&quot; Slogan aside, there is no sign of Barack Obama on Starr&apos;s new record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Y Not will be released on 12 January 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355844801|2009-11-25T21:07:12|8e473294b10ee966fb2f38aaa09c4cf918d807ae --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Like the Clash&apos;s White Riot, Sound of the Beast begins with a police siren so realistic that you look up from whatever you&apos;re doing and think: &quot;What&apos;s going on?&quot; But, in the 27 years that separate these two songs, the technology has changed: the old two-note horns have been replaced by synthesised oscillators that, in another context, could sound like abrasive electronica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shy FX&apos;s second single builds on this idea, fading an oscillated siren in and out of a repeated, ragga-style chorus that mocks the sound: &quot;Woop! Woop! That&apos;s the sound of the police! That&apos;s the sound of the beast!&quot; This is underscored by the classic jungle patch: the dive-bombing bass and the hyper-speed break-beat – the &quot;Amen Break&quot;, taken from the Winstons&apos; 1969 single Amen, Brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then in comes in another element: the repeated introduction to Junior Murvin&apos;s Police and Thieves, from scratched vinyl (you can hear the clicks). Sped up to fit the 1990s, the original song weaves in and out of the six-minute Sound of the Beast: sometimes the verses, sometimes the chorus and, on occasion, two simple verbal refrains, &quot;Oh yeah&quot; and &quot;Hey ha ha ha ha hey&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sound of the Beast was one of the big tunes at the 1994 Notting Hill Carnival, blasting in and out of phase from the sound systems. There&apos;s always tension at the carnival, particularly on the last day, and the tune&apos;s brutal simplicity fit the mood. And, with the remoulding of Murvin&apos;s 1976 classic, there was continuity between past and present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of Police and Thieves is well recounted by Laurence Cane-Honeysett in the recent Universal reissue of the Murvin album of the same name. Written and recorded in response to the rising civil and political unrest in Jamaica – which culminated in June 1976 with a national State of Emergency – the track took on a life of its own when it arrived in the UK during the summer of 1976. There were rising levels of unemployment, although not quite as drastic as those in Jamaica. Factor in a surge of support for the National Front and heavy-handed policing – crystallised in the notorious and archaic &quot;suspected person&quot; or &quot;sus&quot; laws that were, in fact, part of the 1824 Vagrancy Act – and all the ingredients for a serious upheaval were there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had been a riot at the 1975 carnival, but the mood a year later was even more oppressive. I went on the Sunday and saw lines of police directing thousands of people through small, claustrophobic streets; a spontaneous chant rippled through the crowd, gaining in strength: &quot;Coming down, coming down, coming down.&quot; The trouble began that night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, 30 August, the area towards the bottom end of Portobello Road erupted. In the ensuing riot, more than 100 police were injured and 66 carnival-goers arrested, but the impact was greater than the statistics. It was national news: a victory for the local black community and another symptom of a nation falling apart at the seams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police and Thieves was the song of the 1976 carnival. It was the reggae single of the year in Black Echoes, and spent 23 weeks on the Melody Maker&apos;s reggae chart. It was also covered by the Clash – white boys caught up in a riot that was not their own – on their first album, which was framed by Rocco McCauley&apos;s photos of the event. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early-to-mid 90s, jungle was everywhere in London, spilling out of sound systems and pirate stations, the city&apos;s secret news. Evolving out of hardcore, it mashed up rave, reggae, soundtrack and ragga in a delirious, darkside psychedelia: find if you can the early Hardcore Leaders comps on Kickin&apos;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shy FX&apos;s third single, the rude boy anthem Original Nuttah (with UK Apache, 1994), injected a healthy note of ragga braggadocio into the mix. Sound of the Beast partakes of that same ecstatic outsiderdom but is less vocal, more impressionistic and almost avant garde in its extreme disregard for convention, while still defiantly attitudinal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jungle became drum&apos;n&apos;bass, then it became &quot;intelligent&quot;, then it morphed into grime, which has now gone pop – a fascinating journey. Shy FX went on to a distinguished career, working with Dizzee Rascal on his last two albums. So fast have things gone that, in 2009 terms, Sound of the Beast is almost prehistoric. Yet it still sounds fabulous, navigating the space/time continuum at great speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355847980|2009-11-25T21:07:12|d0d25461701409f6e747e72755716e68f80c080f --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is no doubting Colin Meloy&apos;s ambition for his music. The last time he brought the Decemberists to London from Oregon, the band opened their set with a 20-minute folk-prog-metal epic based on an Irish legend. This time, he dedicates the set&apos;s first hour to the band&apos;s last album, the folk-prog-metal rock opera, The Hazards of Love. As if that&apos;s not off-putting enough, he&apos;s brought along Shara Worden and Becky Stark to help out with the singing, and the latter is dressed (and dances) as if she&apos;s come straight from an assignation with the wood fairies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The format doesn&apos;t play to Meloy&apos;s strengths. He&apos;s a writer of instantly memorable melodies, but Hazards of Love is lighter on those than his previous work, and playing it straight through means Meloy has no opportunity to practise his legendary charm between songs. The album is full of terrific moments, such as the formation drumming exercise of The Rake&apos;s Song, but those moments slide out of focus as the band slides into another lumbering faux-metal riff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 10-song second set, fortunately, highlights the Decemberists&apos; strengths. The Sporting Life – a lament to games lesson inadequacy set to a pounding Motown beat – plays off Meloy&apos;s geek-made-good persona. The Engine Driver receives the loudest cheer of the night, and a rambling story about God being so upset with the poor quality of a song fragment called Dracula&apos;s Daughter that he wept a single tear that carved the Thames valley makes imaginative leaps that you won&apos;t get from, say, La Roux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A beautiful new song played in the encore, January Hymn, offers hope that next time they visit, the Decemberists will play to their strengths, rather than indulging their inner Rick Wakeman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 355877368|2009-11-25T21:07:12|13482053b7f583176f95aa681f2e9e33ded4597a --&gt;</body>
