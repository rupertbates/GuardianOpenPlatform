        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Forget &quot;read my lips&quot;. When doing business with Madeleine Albright, former US ambassador to the UN and Bill Clinton&apos;s secretary of state, you&apos;re better off with &quot;read my brooch&quot;. In her new book, just published in the US, Albright reveals that the brooch she chose to wear on her left lapel was determined by the state of play in ongoing diplomatic negotiations. So while Yasser Arafat was treated to a wasp, the South Korean president, Kim Dae-jung, got a more welcoming&amp;nbsp;sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fad kicked off after the Gulf war in 1994 when the Iraqi press referred to her as an &quot;unparalleled serpent&quot; and she decided to wear a coiled snake to her next meeting with Saddam Hussein. By the time she left office she had a collection of more than 300 brooches – most of them picked up for next to nothing at flea markets – including a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and a gold UFO with three aliens – presumably for meetings with the Taliban and David Icke respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly we never got to find out what she would choose for a meeting with Gordon Brown – a dead man walking? - but her brooch idea has already broached the Labour stronghold. When Hazel Blears resigned from the cabinet in June, she wore a sinking ship – with the message, &quot;Rocking the boat&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picture above: For the Middle-East peace talks in 1999, Albright would occasionally wear a wasp for her meetings with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. &quot;I wore wasps on tough days when I wanted to do a little stinging and deliver a tough message.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353856668|2009-10-06T21:58:29|3cd6d93d5c9b879cf371938b577565ece55a4c30 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;France is in uproar over news that McDonald&apos;s has tainted the hallowed ground of the Louvre. The chain has confirmed that its 1,142nd French outlet will open next month in the underground approach to the art museum. The Parisian authorities haven&apos;t always capitulated to capitalist invaders, though. In 1993, they refused permission to put a McDonald&apos;s under the Eiffel&amp;nbsp;Tower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other nations have resisted the powerful golden arches too. Italian designer Valentino led a charge to stop McDonald&apos;s setting up beside Rome&apos;s Spanish Steps (though there are now two branches within 150m). So where else in the world might tourists stumble on an unfortunately placed concession?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• After 580 years and 24 emperors, Beijing&apos;s Forbidden City got its first franchise in 2000 – a Starbucks. The shop&apos;s sign was taken down in 2005 after complaints but it took half a million petition signatures (led by a popular TV news anchor who claimed it was &quot;eroding Chinese culture&quot;) before the franchise was removed in 2007. Still, this hasn&apos;t kept Starbucks away from China&apos;s Unesco Heritage Sites. In 2005, the Seattle-based coffee maker breached the Great Wall, setting up shop at the popular Badaling section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• There is a McDonald&apos;s underneath the Museum of Communism in Prague. In fact, one visitor to the Czech capital posted on a website that&amp;nbsp;the museum was advertising itself around the city with the tag, &quot;We&apos;re above McDonald&apos;s, across from Benetton.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• You can contemplate Egypt&apos;s Great Pyramid through the window of a Pizza Hut (pictured above). Where is&amp;nbsp;it located? Right on top of a&amp;nbsp;KFC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Not content with 31,000 outlets worldwide, McDonald&apos;s is still on the march. In September 2008, the burger chain opened a restaurant in Peru on Cusco&apos;s Plaza de Armas, named by the Project for Public Spaces as one of the 60 great places in the world. McDonald&apos;s made one concession for the sake of cultural preservation, replacing its neon yellow M with a more discreet brown one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353855022|2009-10-06T21:58:29|33c873cae652bbe9bc9444afcf1a0712cdf81126 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;It has no campus, no lecture theatres and hardly any paid staff, but the International University of the People, which opened last month, does have one big plus point – no tuition fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, and the fact that its courses are taught entirely online and are designed to make it accessible to people who, because of poverty, geography or personal restrictions, would never contemplate university study. &quot;Hundreds of millions of people deserve to get education and don&apos;t,&quot; says UoPeople&apos;s founder, Shai Reshef, a California b usinessman. &quot;We are showing a way that this mass of people can be educated in a very efficient and inexpensive way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university&apos;s ambition to democratise education, combined with its not-for-profit ethos, has brought it support from humanitarian organisations, including the UN&apos;s Global Alliance for ICT and Development. But its teaching model, which uses open-source technology, the increasing availability of free educational material available online, social networking and more than 800 volunteer educators, has also attracted attention because of broader implications for the way higher education will be delivered in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The concept is great, and one we&apos;ll see more and more,&quot; says Peter Scott, director of the Knowledge Media Institute at the Open University, which itself gives free access to course materials through the OpenLearn website. He says so much high-quality material now exists on the web that traditional university models can no longer be seen as the only arbiters of quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintaining quality will nevertheless be an important challenge for the UoPeople, which does not yet have accreditation, and which relies on academic volunteers to answer questions, monitor discussions, mentor students and develop curricula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reshef says his experience as chair of the board at Cramster.com, a website on which students, scholars and subject enthusiasts answer each other&apos;s questions, showed him how willing people were to help one another online, and how powerful that could be. But even he was surprised that so many volunteers came forward to help his UoPeople project. They include retired professors, graduate students and specialists in computing. The university also has an advisory committee made up mainly of academics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Greenwood, professor of law at the Hofstra University school of law, New York, has volunteered a day a week, as well as to serve on the advisory committee. He wanted to help make education more widely available and liked the idea of being in on something new and potentially huge: &quot;the notion that you can create something that can be expanded to serve tens of thousands of students who otherwise wouldn&apos;t be able to access education&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another committee member is Jack Balkin, a professor at Yale Law School, and founder of Yale&apos;s Information Society Project, which has just entered into a research partnership with UoPeople to explore ways of improving access to knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university is still at the experimental stage, and relatively small. It was launched last month with 178 students from nearly 50 countries, and provides just two undergraduate programmes, business administration and computer science – each expected to take four years to complete. Applicants need to have a high school diploma, be proficient in English, and to have internet access, as well as passing orientation courses in computer skills and English composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dan Narita, 30, who is among the first intake of computer science students, says he was attracted both by the flexibility of the course, which allows him to continue his work in London as an architect while studying, and by its newness. &quot;I like the fact that it&apos;s an innovative model,&quot; he says. Social networking is a crucial part of the way the university works. Each week, groups of 20 students enter an online &quot;classroom&quot;, similar to a discussion forum, in which they find the transcript of a lecture, with associated references and reading material. They also find an assignment, and a discussion question, which forms the core of their study. Each student is expected to contribute original ideas to the week&apos;s discussion, and to comment at least four times in the week on the ideas of fellow students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If students have a question that cannot be answered within the classroom, they can enter a social networking forum made up of all the university&apos;s students as well as volunteer educators. There they can post a question, broach a topic not covered in the classroom discussion, or even access one-to-one time with a professor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott says the amount of support students get from the online community is likely to prove crucial, as is the quality of assessment: &quot;You cannot assess everything with multiple choice questions, and at the end of a quality experience is a reasonably skilled academic&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Bradwell, whose report for the thinktank Demos, The Edgeless University, published earlier this year, argued that universities could be transformed by new technology, agrees that while the UoPeople is exciting, its success will depend on the quality of the academics behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reshef concedes there are still aspects of the university to be finessed – not least how to raise the relatively small sums needed to run it. While he has put up $1m (£626,000) of his own cash, he is still looking for a further $5m. Nor will the university be entirely free, with students charged registration fees of between $15 and $50 depending on their country of residence and between $10 and $100 per exam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the important thing, he says, is that his university offers many students their only hope of higher education. &quot;The majority have no other alternative&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353749378|2009-10-06T21:58:29|3a4164867c9067eccf758c4c5c30faa019066904 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;As the most optimistic Conservative party conference for over a decade takes place, only months before a general election, I have been studying Michael Gove&apos;s proposed school reforms listed on his party&apos;s website. This list of 13 points does not include all Tory ideas but indicates some likely actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;? First, improve discipline in schools and shift the balance of power back to teachers. This is a fine aspiration ? would any teacher object ? but, without convincing suggestions of how it might be achieved, it is worthless. Yet, when respect for authority is no longer automatic and when many children have been brought up in a home regime of perpetual negotiations, an investigation of how discipline could be improved would be a helpful prologue to action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;? Second, get every child &quot;capable of doing so&quot; reading by the age of six. This is admirable if it means that all those who show early difficulties gain access to properly funded programmes, such as Marie Clay&apos;s Reading Recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;? Third, reform the testing regime in primary schools. This is a crucial task because, as the Commons select committee noted, &quot;high stakes testing&quot; (with serious consequences for pupils, teachers and schools) has distorted and impoverished the curriculum. The alternative, testing to support learning, cannot, however, be used for league tables ? a point I do not think Gove recognises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;? Fourth, increase &quot;teaching by ability&quot;. In theory, this &quot;stretches the strongest and nurtures the weakest&quot;. But in practice, it has been found wanting by most serious research. An investigation of the optimum ways to group pupils, without lowering expectations and damaging self esteem, is long overdue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;? Fifth, reform inspection. A review would be timely given the monopolistic stranglehold that Ofsted has over educational practice. But pre-empting the outcome to ensure that it is &quot;tougher&quot; is unlikely to solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;? Sixth, &quot;champion excellence in the&amp;nbsp;comprehensive sector&quot; and &quot;generously reward those who deliver for&amp;nbsp;the poorest&quot;. Excellent aims. But, if the intention is to create a genuine comprehensive sector, these aims need to go hand in hand with the abolition of selection; conversion of&amp;nbsp;existing grammar schools into institutions serving all pupils by, perhaps, teaching only A-levels; and the removal of charitable status from private schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;? Seventh, create &quot;over 220,000 new school places&quot; to increase choice. This would be questionable even if public finances were not due a hefty cut. In the circumstances, other than providing extra places for birth increases, such expansion seems profligate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;? Eighth, 12th and 13th are about allowing charities, philanthropists, groups of parents etc to set up new, publicly funded ? and often &quot;small&quot; ? schools. How wise it is to allow parents ? whose interest may be time-limited to their child&apos;s presence, or groups who know nothing about school management to have access to substantial public funds is highly questionable. Gove cites developments in Sweden in support. Yet no mention is made of Swedish evaluations which show that, while some middle-class parents have welcomed the developments, there is serious concern over the increasing segregation of social and ethnic groups. Is this what our 21st-century society needs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;? Ninth, ensure funding for deprivation &quot;goes direct to the pupils&quot; instead of &quot;bureaucracies&quot;. This sounds fine in theory, but, as anyone who has created enhanced learning opportunities knows, is impossible to achieve. Special schemes need organisation and support and these cost money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;? The 10th and 11th proposals are about diverting more resources to disadvantaged pupils. Again this is an excellent principle. Though the sums involved will&amp;nbsp;have to be large if they are to match up to the knowhow and the cultural capital that middle-class parents lavish on their children. And the costs will have&amp;nbsp;to be robustly defended against those who will doubtless claim that they are unfair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My evaluation of the package is that it contains a few good ideas, some old ideological chestnuts and several wasted opportunities. While some of the more simplistic ideas may win votes, Gove needs to clarify Conservative thinking if he hopes to make sound and lasting improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is comment. GNM does not necessarily support the views expressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353752671|2009-10-06T21:58:30|f40b6162ed78e59bc9ad0d5f982ac2f2086decb2 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;&quot;By the time you get home from work and pick up the kids, it&apos;s hard to sit down and make the time to read with them,&quot; says single parent Aredi Christou. &quot;You just want to put the washing on and cook tea.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s a scenario that will probably be recognised by plenty of busy parents who sense that they need to introduce their young children to books, but somehow find that life keeps getting in the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christou, however, says that the information she was given in her daughter&apos;s free Bookstart packs motivated her to modify her routine. &quot;It gave me a bit of a push, really, because I&apos;m a single mum, and working full time. It was a really easy-to-follow leaflet, and explained that libraries have lots of other things to do that would interest my son, who is 13,&quot; she explains. &quot;So now, I work 8am-4pm, pick them up from school, and there&apos;s a library not too far away that doesn&apos;t close till 6pm. My son will do his homework, and I&apos;ll sit down with Demi to choose books together that she&apos;d like to read. I try to go about once a week.&quot; This is one example of how the national Bookstart scheme, which first kicks in when an infant reaches the age of seven months, can be a catalyst that helps families make reading an integral part of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Friday is National Bookstart Day, and to mark the event, the charity Booktrust, which runs the scheme, has done a survey of the nation&apos;s favourite nursery rhymes. Although nursery rhymes are fun to chant and act out, at a more serious level, says Booktrust, exposure to the rhyme and repetition is vital in helping children understand how language works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If children are able to hear the sounds in words and to discriminate between them, both in rhymes and in first-letter sounds, it seems to be a predictor of later reading success,&quot; says Professor Roger Beard, head of the department of early childhood and primary education at the Institute of Education. &quot;It reminds us that reading isn&apos;t just a visual skill, it&apos;s also an auditory skill.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for some parents, explains Karen Wilkinson, Bookstart co-ordinator at Wakefield council, there are considerable barriers to be overcome before they&apos;ll feel comfortable handling books around their children. Getting two free books when their child hits seven months, 18 months and three years old may be a prompt, but many will need more encouragement to start turning the pages. &quot;It&apos;s not as simple as assuming that the reason parents don&apos;t use books with children is that they have literacy problems of their own,&quot; she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents don&apos;t always grasp, for instance, why reading a book to a little baby is helpful or relevant, she says. Some are scared their baby will chew the book or tear it. Others believe a child needs to be talking before using a book, or they might simply have no idea what sort of book would be of interest. These are anxieties Wilkinson tries to dispel in the talks she gives to parents from hard-to-reach groups, such as inmates at the mother and baby unit at the local prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bookstart can also be the way that parents admit their concerns about their own literacy needs, says Wilkinson. &quot;I reassure them that you don&apos;t, with a young child, need to be too concerned with reading the words, you can point to the pictures, and when you get to the stage of needing to improve your own literacy to support your child&apos;s reading, we can guide you in that,&quot; she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 90% of parents get their free packs at around the right time, though it&apos;s more of a challenge to get the packs to the parents of toddlers, says head of Booktrust&apos;s bookgifting department, Rosemary Clarke. Many mothers will have returned to work by this time, so are less likely to attend the health visitor-run sessions that are the primary route for handing them out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s a fact that some families are harder to reach than others,&quot; says Clarke, explaining that for people who tend not to access services in the usual way, such as Romany parents, young mothers or newly arrived asylum seekers, Booktrust tries to ensure that relevant professionals ? lone-parent support workers, Traveller education service workers and asylum support workers ? can gift the books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for parents who are tentative at first, says Wilkinson, a very little time spent &quot;modelling&quot; how to use books with their babies can make all the difference to their willingness to continue the activity at home. &quot;When the parent sees the child&apos;s eyes light up, they&apos;re very receptive. I try to get&amp;nbsp;across the idea that when you share a book with a baby, you&apos;re not teaching them to read, you&apos;re teaching them that books are fun.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Booktrust asked 2,500 people to name their favourite nursery rhyme. The winner will be announced on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top 10, in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;? Humpty Dumpty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;? Jack and Jill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;? Baa Baa Black Sheep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;? Hickory Dickory Dock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;? Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;? Little Miss Muffet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;? The Grand Old Duke of York&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;? Incey Wincey Spider&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;? Round and Round the Garden&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;?

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Tories have added a shopping mall to their conference. Behind the main hall you can find Harvey Nichols, M&amp;amp;S, Crombie, Austin Reed, a place where you can be measured for a suit, a stall selling carpeting, even a stand where you may buy Conservative Conference 2009 Christmas tree baubles, three for £10. How festive can you get? It&apos;s for a home where you might expect a Conservative policy review in your stocking, or a Dominic Grieve action doll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most British airports these days are just retail opportunities with a few planes waiting around outside; in the same way, it must be infuriating if you pop along to order some carpet for the front room and can&apos;t hear yourself think because of the politicians droning on next door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This air of surreal, dreamlike oddness extends to the conference itself. Labour calls its chairmen &quot;chair&quot; even when they&apos;re men. But the Tories&apos; chair for the week, Emma Pidding, is addressed as &quot;chairman&quot;, though she is clearly a woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conference chairman is different from the party chair, who is male, specifically Eric Pickles, built on the lines of a gigantic gherkin, and who addressed us as &quot;my dear chums&quot;, which made him seem a bit too much like a creepy scoutmaster for my tastes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His main task seemed to be to depress the mood. &quot;Be under no illusion, the general election is not in the bag. We still have a mountain to climb.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having sprayed them with gloom, he left them to Oliver Letwin, who ought to be in that new film, The Invention of Lying, because he can&apos;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He gave a long and dry account of new Tory policies. When one created a faint stir in the audience, he pleaded: &quot;You&apos;re not supposed to clap. This presentation is supposed to be so factual, there is not a single clap-line in it. Sorry.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d love to have heard him at the Winter Palace: &quot;Look, the tsar is doing a not bad job under quite difficult circumstances …&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francis Maude was slightly more exciting. He announced a magnificently bizarre plan to have the public monitor government spending through the internet: &quot;We shall unleash an army of armchair auditors who will crawl all over the government&apos;s accounts!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He made them sound like the Wehrmacht, crawling all over Poland, only in comfy recliners instead of tanks. And what will happen when this unleashed army has finished its crawling operations? Will they be sent into Afghanistan with too few Parker-Knolls and inadequate slippers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boris Johnson cheered them up a bit, with a speech of which large parts were in English, as opposed to Latin. They liked his attack on Harriet Harman for driving away from the scene of an accident. &quot;It is up to us to sweep up the crushed indicator lights of a classic Labour car crash!&quot; But what really got them going was his pledge to reintroduce Routemaster buses and to restore the river Thames to the London tube map. Much more exciting than the national debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon members of the shadow cabinet stood in line and made little speeches. They looked like the defendants at a Soviet show trial, and not much perkier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Cameron then made a surprise appearance. He also told them how horribly difficult it would be to win the election. Thus thoroughly depressed, they could only cheer themselves up with some marrons glacés from Harvey Nicks, £4.95.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is comment. GNM does not necessarily support the views expressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353864300|2009-10-06T21:58:30|9bd1db7bdf1a7e421c68ca9c4c108977680e1664 --&gt;</body>

      <type-specific class="article">
        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sean Long, settling over a prawn sandwich and bottle of water at a country hotel outside Wigan, reflects cheerfully on another tumultuous weekend. The previous evening he had played his final home game for St Helens, after 12 years at a club where every success on the field has been matched by controversy off it. Long scored a crucial try and set up another in the 14?10 win that guaranteed St Helens a place, for the third successive year, in this weekend&apos;s Grand Final against Leeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet it was his defence that was the most compelling facet of last Saturday&apos;s headline-winning performance against his hometown club, Wigan, who had rejected him as a teenager. Long might have been even more troubled at 18 than at the height of his infamy but the intensity of his tackling spoke of a man who still bears a grudge against Wigan ? where he continues to live his madcap life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I had a lot on my mind all Saturday,&quot; a battered Long says, chewing thoughtfully on his delicate sandwich. &quot;It was my last game at Knowsley Road so it was quite emotional. In the dressing room before a game we usually just shake hands. But all the boys came and gave me a love.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long wraps his arms around himself, to show how fondly he was embraced. &quot;It could have been the last game we played together so that got me going.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 33-year-old has won the Grand Final four times, and is the only player in rugby league history to have been awarded the sport&apos;s most evocative individual prize, the Lance Todd Trophy, for the man of the match at the Challenge Cup final, on three separate occasions. Yet, typically for Long, he prepared for Saturday&apos;s semi-final by publicising his autobiography (Longy: Booze, Brawls, Sex and Scandal, published by John Blake) that afternoon in a St Helens bookshop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I signed about 500 books,&quot; he grins. The coach, Mick Potter, was apparently relaxed about the diversion ? believing, much to the player&apos;s amusement, that Long would have spent the afternoon washing his car had he not been peddling a book thick with sensation. &quot;Why write a book if you&apos;re not going to be honest?&quot; Long shrugs. &quot;I&apos;m an honest bloke. Saints have been cool. Saints have been sweet. The chairman said I had a couple of things wrong but he also said, &apos;I&apos;ve read the book and it&apos;s hilarious.&apos; I&apos;ve not lied or bagged the game. I&apos;m just telling my side of the story.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His former team-mate Martin Gleeson almost choked on his pint when he heard Long had written an autobiography. &quot;Who&apos;s publishing it,&quot; Gleeson snorted. &quot;Fucking Ladybird?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long, it can be safely written, is not a literary man. When he first spotted his future wife, Claire, working as a cabin attendant on a flight Saints took to Lanzarote, his initial thought of &quot;Come to Papa&quot; was soon replaced by anxiety. Realising he would not be able to chat her up in front of his team-mates he worried that his plan to write her a note would leave her thinking she had been propositioned by a seven-year-old. In the end he convinced his captain, Paul Sculthorpe, to pen the letter on his behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and Claire ended up together, with three children, but his autobiography has caused friction at home. &quot;She was quite surprised and a little upset by some of the stuff,&quot; Long grimaces. &quot;She&apos;s a really nice girl, my wife, who&apos;s been brought up really well. We had a couple of chats about it and I reminded her that most of the stuff happened before I met her.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less personally, Long now goes even further by adding more to his published revelations about the public saga which left him, in his words, &quot;at the centre of the biggest scandal to ever hit my sport&quot;. Long and Gleeson had each wagered £1,000 that Saints would lose to Bradford in April 2004. They were convinced of the outcome because Long was injured and Ian Millward, then their coach, was going to rest 11 other senior players. Long and Gleeson could not help themselves and, as excitable as they were stupid, placed the bets in their own names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his book Long suggests that they were not alone. &quot;Everyone seemed to have money on Bradford. Players, mates of players, the bloke who sells the pies, the bloke who sells the pies&apos; milkman, the milkman&apos;s postman, the postman&apos;s mistress ?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the banter, more serious questions need to be asked. How many players placed an illegal bet on that game? &quot;I don&apos;t know. I&apos;d say ?&quot; Long pauses, putting down his sandwich as he calculates the odds. Half-a-dozen? &quot;Yeah, half-a-dozen. Maybe more ?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having broken his jaw badly, for the third time, this summer, the left side of Long&apos;s face remains afflicted with a kind of paralysis. If the damaged nerves should eventually heal, it currently means that, while the right side is as expressive as ever, the left side of his face is unable to move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contrast between the two sides is telling as he counts the players who might have bet on a Bradford win. Could that number reach 10? &quot;Yeah, probably. I could get in trouble here by saying Bradford had a bet on it but I&apos;ve spoken to two players who don&apos;t play for them anymore who had a bet on that game. [Bradford] keep saying, &apos;Oh, we didn&apos;t have a bet on the game.&apos; They didn&apos;t but two players I spoke to did. So either they&apos;re telling me lies or ?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His implication is clear: the unnamed Bradford players placed their bets through a third party. &quot;Of course. They&apos;re cleverer than us. Me and Glees are a little naive and thick.&quot; How many other Saints players had also bet on the match? &quot;Half-a-dozen. Yeah. Half-a-dozen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet only Long and Gleeson were caught and punished ? with Long accepting his three-month ban and £50,000 in fines and legal fees. &quot;I don&apos;t mind. We took the rap for everyone really. It&apos;s only because we fucked up and put it in our own name ? otherwise no one would have known. You know what I mean? You could still go bet on a rugby match now and get someone else to put it in your name. No one would know. If we had done it right none of this would have come out. They had to make an example of us.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does betting, which has always been against Super League rules, still occur among players today? &quot;I would say people who like a bet may have a bet on rugby,&quot; Long says carefully, raising his right eyebrow. The left remains stock-still. &quot;They just get someone else to put it on for them.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long looks amused but sounds as if he is dealing in hard facts. &quot;I don&apos;t know what other people do,&quot; he says more archly, &quot;but if you like watching rugby, and there was some money on it, it would be better watching for you ? if you know what I mean. If someone has £50 on a team to win, and you obviously don&apos;t know the outcome, a betting player would get someone to put the bet on for him. Why not? It makes the game more interesting. It&apos;s not like you&apos;ve got inside information, like me and Glees did. It&apos;s like betting on football and saying &apos;I&apos;ll have £10 on Rooney to score.&apos;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insisting that he no longer bets on rugby league, and that he does not know any players who wagered money on fixtures involving their own team, Long admits to placing a different gamble even before the Bradford debacle. He wagered money that Saints would score the first points in a Super League match via a drop-goal. &quot;In fact that&apos;s probably worse than the other one,&quot; he says. &quot;But it never came off.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than feeling remorseful Long enjoyed parts of his gambling expose when he and Gleeson were tailed by the national press and they went into hiding in a caravan. &quot;It was a really mad buzz. I hope I don&apos;t have to do it again but, yeah, it was a massive buzz.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s safe to assume his team-mates have not been as enthusiastic about his book. &quot;A couple of them did say, &apos;You&apos;ve not mentioned my name?&apos; and I said, &apos;No, you&apos;re all right.&apos; I could have gone to town with names. But I didn&apos;t want to hurt anyone. The only one I want to take the piss out of is me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the ritual tales of boozing and bonking, a residual sadness rises to the surface. &quot;I went off the rails big time in 2002,&quot; Long sighs, tugging at his dreadlocks. &quot;I don&apos;t know why but I got a bit of a depression. People think if you&apos;re having sex all the time, and going out drinking, it&apos;s great. But I was crying out for someone. It was a bad time in my life. You know when you&apos;re unhappy and you&apos;ve got a bad head and you&apos;re looking at all these people passed out in your house. You think, &apos;Who are these people? What the fuck am I doing?&apos; Luckily for me, the year after, I met Claire.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long is equally certain that he was &quot;saved&quot; by rugby league. &quot;It&apos;s 100% that I would&apos;ve ended up in jail if it hadn&apos;t been for the sport. Rugby saved my life. If it hadn&apos;t been for rugby I would have probably ended up in a gang or been jailed or taking drugs. No doubt.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Long drives us back through Wigan he talks animatedly about the myriad tattoos covering his body, as well as the pain he suffered when, pointing to his groin, he had &quot;the little fella pierced. I&apos;ve still got the ring in today. I always take things to the limit.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long hunches over the wheel and cackles. He might be leaving St Helens after 12 wild and crazy years, and heading for Hull, but he insists, &quot;I was lot more daft at 21. I was crackers then. But I&apos;m a really clever bloke on the field ? and I&apos;m a lot calmer off it. Most of that is down to the missus.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His long-suffering wife has already steeled herself for his Grand Final weekend bender. After Saturday&apos;s game, Long will be in serious partying mode. &quot;Claire knows it,&quot; he says, with a last waggle of his unparalysed eyebrow. &quot;She knows Saturday, Sunday and Monday I&apos;m gone with these lads for the last time. But then I&apos;ll be back on track. I&apos;m not a bad lad. I just do some daft things.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353850486|2009-10-06T21:58:30|c6909b6184ed078e4e72f4a35a7f938ef03ae760 --&gt;</body>

        <body type="html">&lt;p&gt;The first review of Dragon Age, the long awaited RPG from veteran developer Bioware, has gone live and things sound positive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attempting to summarize the experience of Dragon Age in a few paragraphs is almost ridiculous given the depth of the game&apos;s content. Six distinct openings depending on your character (each lasting a couple hours), cool specializations for each class, plenty of tactical variety, and a vast array of sidequests keep you immersed in the world as time flies by. The central narrative arc and the characters involved serve the setting well, but don&apos;t deviate far from expectations. On the other hand, the subplots have some great hooks that I won&apos;t spoil here – though I will say that the mages&apos; tower is awesome. A speed demon could blow through the main story in 40 hours, but thorough players can expect about 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds promising then and a must-buy for RPG fans who own a PC. Console owners should be more wary though as the review is of the PC version, not the 360 or PS3 edition.  Sure, it&apos;s highly unlikely that we&apos;ll have another Risen situation but there&apos;s always that nagging fear that the console versions will suffer. I&apos;m crossing fingers though, as Dragon Age sounds the perfect console game to have on the big screen during the winter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you think then? Interested in Dragon Age or is Modern Warfare 2 the only November release for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353861402|2009-10-06T21:58:30|e4d376c205f215e2a7efa177ca5df6a2bbed3bb6 --&gt;</body>
