          &lt;p&gt;In July 2006 the demise of Girls Aloud was a tabloid splash. "They just don't talk at all. It's all over," reported the News of the World. The villain was Cheryl Tweedy, her head supposedly turned following a World Cup trip to Germany with the England squad "Wags". So far, so predictable ? the surprise came when the split didn't happen. The group enjoyed further hit albums and critical adoration. And Cheryl Tweedy is now Cheryl Cole, tearful nice-cop of Saturday evening TV and ? since the kiss-and-tell stories involving husband Ashley ? Britain's favourite wronged woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift in the media's presentation of Cole has been remarkable. From a Geordie brawler and apprentice Posh Spice she has turn
          ed into a beloved young star, forever "in torment" on weekly magazine covers but still able to tap limitless reserves of empathy. "In these times of doom and gloom," the editor of Grazia said last year, "all we want is a hug from Cheryl."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Few need that hug more than record industry executives, and the Dianafication of Cole means this debut album is the most high-profile pop record of 2009 ? flop-proof in a way girl-group solo records rarely are. Lead single Fight for This Love ? set to be the fastest-selling single of the year ? bears this out. Initially it's underwhelming: hollow drum sounds and a shuddering keyboard create a subdued backdrop for Cole's flinty vocal. But it has two big commercial advantages. First of all, it's deceptively catchy. Second, people can easily imagine it's about Ashley Cole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheryl Cole's public profile is based on her playing heroine to two pantomime villains. Often the moustache-twirling rogue is Simon Cowell, and the nation applauds; th
          e rest of the time it's her own husband. Certainly, 3 Words is being presented as a response to those experiences. For watchers of "tormented Cheryl", there's plenty more doggedness on offer, besides the single. "We argue a lot no matter what we do," she hisses on Make Me Cry, adding: "Careful what you're saying 'cos I'm trying to stay with you." On Rain On Me she snarls:"I won't run ? 'cos if you think I'm weak then that makes you strong." At times like those, 3 Words seems a co-dependents' manifesto: on the jaunty Happy Hour the metaphor for a relationship is that classic romantic standby, alcohol addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But whether you care about her marriage or not, all this anxiety and defiance makes for a low-key, shadowy kind of pop record, whose best songs rarely take immediate hold. Its most upbeat moments are its weakest: Will.I.Am and Cheryl lumbering on to the disco floor on Heaven, and the tinny electropop of Taio Cruz's contribution, Stand Up. Elsewhere the main sound on 3 Words is R
          &amp;amp;B, with any rhythmic trickery stripped out. When it works, as on Parachute, you end up with an austere take on modern pop that gives Cole's voice the space it needs. When it doesn't, songs such as Don't Talk About This Love just end up sounding a bit cheap. Confirmation that this is a recession-era pop album comes with the make-do-and-mend inclusion of Heartbreaker, Will.I.Am's solo hit from last year, billed now as a Cole track despite her contribution amounting to 30 seconds of backing vocals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The album may disappoint Cole's oldest fans. At its best, Girls Aloud's work with the Xenomania production team was smart, inventive and delightful. As a clean break with the Girls Aloud sound, 3 Words at first sounds like a throwback to the 90s, when acts like Louise Redknapp would put us to sleep with their unshakeably nice R&amp;amp;B lite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parts of this album never pass beyond conservative pleasantries. But the shift in sound was still necessary. The typical Xenomania pr
          oduction sound, as heard this autumn on Mini Viva's I Left My Heart in Tokyo, is too busy and shrill for Cole's voice to carry alone. She's not as full a singer as the belters and divas she presides over each week, but she's an expressive performer and a less showy backing lets that come through. Her showcase is the album's title track, built on dark loops of treated acoustic guitar and building into a claustrophobic dance track. It's as brave and novel a song as anything Cole's group have released, and shows how good she can be given a more imaginative setting. Most of 3 Words doesn't provide that: it's ultimately too tentative and slight to be more than a footnote in Cheryl Cole's unstoppable celebrity story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 354617001|2009-10-22T21:32:13|6ce1c19a8ae293722f221062263fc76dda325502 --&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Of the current crop of German baritones, Christian Gerhaher seems the most likely to come anywhere near the great Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau in the range and perception of his performances. Here he takes up a Swiss composer whose songs Fischer-Dieskau championed. Composed in 1931, Othmar Schoeck's Notturno for baritone and string quartet belongs to the period of his greatest song cycles, when his music came closest stylistically to that of the Second Viennese School. There are many passages in these settings of nine poems by Nikolaus Lenau (with the final addition of a fragment by Gottfried Keller) that recall the chromatic world of early Schoenberg, as well as Berg's Lyric Suite. The mood of the five movements is bleakly introspective, though there is some kind of resolution in the final diatonic chaconne. If they cannot quite match the intensity of Fischer-Dieskau's hard-to-find recording, nevertheless Gerhaher and the Rosamunde Quartet project this remarkable work superbly. It would be good to think this might be the start of a Schoeck series from this outstanding young singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&l

          &lt;p&gt;From the first few bars of the Beethoven concerto, the mood of Renaud Capu&amp;ccedil;on's performance is set. Yannick N&amp;eacute;zet-S&amp;eacute;guin nudges the music into life, without any fierce attacks or exaggerated dynamics, and when the soloist enters, it's as if he is reliving some half-remembered reverie. There's more to Beethoven's concerto than dreamy reminiscence, of course, and Capu&amp;ccedil;on's playing does acquire more fibre (if not exactly steel). But despite the musicality of the solo playing, and the attention to detail in N&amp;eacute;zet-S&amp;eacute;guin's accompaniments, there
          remains the feeling that all aspects of the work haven't been covered. With the addition of an extra portion of nutrient-free sweetener, the same approach works effectively for Korngold's concerto, too. Capu&amp;ccedil;on's perfect intonation and exquisite phrasing are exactly what this candyfloss work requires, even if it may not deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 354324851|2009-10-22T21:32:13|c8e5050c82ab78cd9a2e71374fe7f27bd1e507cb --&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;It was Jan Dismas Zelenka's astonishingly forward-looking trio sonatas that prevented his name from sliding into historical obscurity, but now the choral works of this Czech composer (1679-1745) are finding their way into the catalog
          ue. Zelenka was a double-bass player in the orchestra of the Habsburg court in Dresden, and he composed a series of oratorios for performance there - works that became known as sepolcri, and which were the closest to opera that church composers in strictly Lutheran Saxony could ever contemplate. This example elides Old and New Testaments in imagining a meeting between King David, Mary Magdalene and St Peter at Christ's tomb. All the latent theatricality of an opera seems to be lurking in the expressive solos and daring orchestral writing. The performance conveys every scrap of that originality and dramatic potential; it's a real ear-opener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 354325817|2009-10-22T21:32:13|bdb9de509b1c0c82d09be46b126092ce44cbf4b2 --&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Th
          e first of Franz Schmidt's symphonies was released earlier this year to launch Vassily Sinaisky's cycle for Naxos. It revealed the foundations of Schmidt's brand of late Romanticism, which owed as much to Mendelssohn and Schumann as it did to Brahms and Bruckner; that same blend of influences permeates his characterful and sometimes surprising Second Symphony, composed between 1911 and 1913. It's a work requiring a huge orchestra - five clarinets, eight horns - yet the music is rarely bombastic. On the contrary, it's often transparently scored and, as Sinaisky's fine performance with the Malm&amp;ouml; Symphony shows, the ideas, all stemming from the theme heard in the opening movement, are striking. The fill-up, the Fuga Solemnis for organ and brass, is a curiosity, too. Composed in 1937, it was reworked after the Anschluss and incorporated into a cantata called German Resurrection. Unsurprisingly, it has rarely been heard since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by t

          &lt;p&gt;Heinz Holliger's crusade on behalf of the music of Charles Koechlin continues with this coupling of what is perhaps his best-known orchestral piece with one of the strangest of his late works. Les Bandar-Log is part of a cycle of symphonic poems based on Kipling's Jungle Book, completed in 1940. It's a 20-minute scherzo that depicts the monkeys Kipling characterises in his book as vain fashion victims. Koechlin's score touches on a range of early 20th-century styles, from Debussyan impressionism to 12-note technique, but somehow welds all the tongue-in-cheek references into a dazzling whole. The Offrandre Musicale sur le Nom de Bach, meanwhile, could hardly be more different. It's a col
          lection of 12 pieces including organ, piano and ondes Martenot solos, as well as works for quirky ensembles and for an orchestra of 106 players, on the BACH theme, which was inspired by Bach's Musical Offering but never descends into baroque pastiche. It's a cranky, sometimes extraordinary work, which had been performed in its entirety only once before Holliger conducted it in Stuttgart last year, from which this recording is taken. Les Bandar-Log, though, is the main reason for acquiring this disc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 354324464|2009-10-22T21:32:13|f1b1cbad88c3d209a5ca55e82248401d5c35e418 --&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Even before you hear the music, it's hard not to be impressed by Alexandra Burke's debut album. The reason lurks on the last page of the CD booklet: the album's credits, a no-expense-spared supporting cast of blue-chip producers and songwriters. There is Red One, the man behind 2009's two biggest-selling singles, Lady Gaga's Just Dance and Poker Face. There is Stargate, the
          Swedish production team responsible for 21 US top 10 hits, from Beyoncé, Shakira and Rihanna among others. There is Louis Biancaniello, whose roll-call of R&amp;amp;B smashes stretches back to Shanice's 1991 hit I Love Your Smile and whose CV takes in Diana Ross, Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston and – perhaps a little less likely to take their place among the pantheon of legendary soul singers – H and Claire from Steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even as you boggle at the assembled talent, you feel a slight unease. What do some of the other X&amp;nbsp;Factor finalists, who had substantially less care, attention and cash lavished on&amp;nbsp;them, make of all this? Not Leona Lewis, who was furnished with an equally glittering production and songwriting team. But who's going to&amp;nbsp;break the news to Leon Jackson, forced to make do with&amp;nbsp;cast-offs from a&amp;nbsp;singer called Stefanie Heinzmann who's apparently quite big on the world-renowned Swiss&amp;nbsp;soul scene? What&amp;nbsp;of the feelings of&am
          p;nbsp;Steve  Brookstein, cast out into an unforgiving&amp;nbsp;world with no top-dollar collaborators and only a cover of Yah Mo&amp;nbsp;B There for company?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason, of course, is money – apparently the motivational force behind every aspect of Simon Cowell's life, up to and including his thrifty decision, despite an estimated fortune of £123m, to continue getting his hair cut&amp;nbsp;at Mr Topper's (where a flat top, bafflingly accessorised with a centre parting, costs £7). As Leona Lewis proved, you can flog a beautiful young pop-R&amp;amp;B singer to the Yanks if she makes the right record; with the best will in the world, a 40-year-old pub singer from Mitcham huffing his way through Against All Odds is going to be&amp;nbsp;an impossible sell, regardless of who's twiddling the knobs. And so Overcome has clearly been put together with eyes fixed firmly across the Atlantic. You could tell as much from Burke's recent X&amp;nbsp;Factor guest appearance, where she performed Bad Boys and
          attempted to drum up interest in the single's guest rapper. "What about Flo Rida, everyone?" she gamely cried, to a nonplussed response from a studio audience who clearly would have had difficulty telling Flo Rida from Floella Benjamin. Despite a couple of hits, the&amp;nbsp;rapper means a lot more in the US&amp;nbsp;than the UK, British record-buyers having perhaps been put off by the title of his debut album, Mail On Sunday, which somehow suggests a load of Timbaland-produced club jams bemoaning falling house prices in the south-east and Labour stealth taxes on middle-class families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, America isn't exactly suffering from a national shortage of beautiful young pop-R&amp;amp;B singers, hence the all-star supporting cast to bolster Burke's chances, it being a given that she can belt it out: no one wins The X&amp;nbsp;Factor honking like Ian Brown. If the album's only real sonic surprise comes with the clattering rhythm of Broken Heels – which bears the improbable influence of Adam
          and the Ants – it's certainly a spectacularly polished product. You could argue Bad Boys is a&amp;nbsp;generic single, based around the glitter-beat and rave synthesiser combination that's currently pop's factory-default setting, but it's a superior example of the type, furnished with an effortlessly unshakeable chorus. So too are Good Night and Morning, a duet with Ne-Yo founded on a slippery drum'n'bass rhythm, and All Night Long. The ballads are seldom the highlight of any pop-soul album, but at&amp;nbsp;least here they come equipped with booming post-Umbrella beats to distract you from the river of lyrical drivel – you&amp;nbsp;lift me up, been hurt so many times before, some things are worth fighting for, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only real problems come when Overcome forgets to conceal Burke's primetime ITV origins. Bury Me and You Broke My Heart are Motown pastiches that seem a little too craven and obvious in their pursuit of the Duffy market. And then there's Hallelujah, lurking at the end like
          the Ghost of Christmas Past, still sounding ungainly reworked as a gospel belter, as if someone had overheard the song – possibly while having their amazing coiffure attended to in Mr Topper's – and clocked the title and the melody but not the lyrics. It's the one moment on the album when Alexandra Burke sounds exactly like a TV talent show winner. The rest of the time she doesn't, which means Overcome and its stellar cast have done their job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 354298721|2009-10-22T21:32:13|a5fd0fffad191a52e1929d7b3fc7d9e3b0230541 --&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Nitty Gritty Dirt Band assured their place in country and rock history in 1972, when the young California musicians recorded the triple album Will the Circle Be Unbroken? with a batch of veteran country heroes including Doc Watson, Maybelle Carter and Earl Scruggs. Like the Byrds, they brought country music to a new rock audience, but they pla
          ced a greater emphasis on old-style country and folk roots, and in the process helped to create the genre that became known as Americana. Their first album in five years is an agreeably varied, no-nonsense set that avoids over-production on songs that range from good-time country blues and bluegrass to folk balladry, with a dash of country pop thrown in. There's some fine harmony singing here, but it's the instrumental work that makes them special, from John McEuen's intricate and moody banjo work on his own Lost in the Pines to Jimmie Fadden's harmonica on Tulsa Sounds Like Trouble to Me. Then there's a stomping revival of the country-blues favourite Going Up the Country and of the Gerry Rafferty hit Stuck in the Middle, now dressed up with rippling banjo. A couple of the ballads veer towards MOR, but they are still a great band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 354321962|2009-10-22T21

          &lt;p&gt;Atlas Sound is the solo project of Bradford
          Cox, frontman of US art-rockers Deerhunter. Logos is Cox's second LP as Atlas Sound in two years and, though it was recorded in fits and spurts, you can hear the touches of delicacy on almost every track. The highlight is Walkabout, which has Noah "Panda Bear" Lennox of Animal Collective singing and features a wonderful looped organ sample from the Dovers' 1965 track What Am I Going to Do. Like Animal Collective's best work, Logos manages to combine simple melodies with enough experimentalism to allow you to keep returning to the record with fresh ears, but not too much to reduce it to avant-garde mush. That would be an achievement even with months of studio wizardry, but Cox assures us that the whole record was done wholly in first takes. In which case, this is quite an accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 354315929|2009-10-22T21:32:13|f557eb6b844c0e72bf98faeabd2f6a1d31cf

          &gt;Tord Gustavsen's meditative but subtly gospel-tinged music has brought him a big following outside the jazz loop: his 2003 album, Changing Places, was the biggest ECM debut in a decade. The Norwegian pianist tours the UK for nine days from today, and returns in November for the London jazz festival. Gustavsen's earlier albums have been for a low-lights piano trio, but this is a quartet set featuring the excellent Jan Garbarek-inspired saxophonist Tore Brunborg, plus guest appearances from singer Kristin Asbjørnsen. Brunborg, though wistfully Garbarek-like on soprano at the opening, is rougher and less ethereal than his model - closer even to Wayne Shorter's enigmatic jazziness on The Gaze. His powerful role makes Gustavsen's piano mainly supportive until halfway through, when the leader blossoms out on Left Over Lullaby No 1. Kristin Asbjørnsen's voice - banshee-like on high notes, but as raspingly bluesy as Carol Grimes on occasion - is always arresting, whether on free improv, floating lullabies or incan
          tations of WH Auden poems. For those who felt Gustavsen's work was a bit pallid, here's the remedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 354320552|2009-10-22T21:32:13|c9b950f7d644a5468d924dd1ed5855dddbc82648 --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The American guitarist Wayne Krantz is a real one-off. He sounds somewhere between John Scofield and Bill Frisell at times, and he has toured in the legacy version of Steely Dan, which has had an audible impact on his playing. But Krantz is also an unflinching adventurer who dislikes repeating himself or imitating others, and possibly dislikes the music industry even more. This trio's famously long residency at New York's 55 Bar used to be documented by downloadable recordings of the gigs the same night, and though the guitarist has access to a conventional recording studio here, he has kept the same improvisational live feel, augmenting it with some overdubbed theme statements and quirkily offhand vocal
            s on four tracks. Krantz is accompanied by his regular partners, Tim Lefebvre (bass) and Keith Carlock (drums), and the bone-crunching three-way conversation they keep up joins the impact of a heavy rock power-trio to the harmonic sleight-of-hand and melodic slipperiness of a contemporary jazz band. Some pieces are dark, churning, raw-sound growls, while others are drawlingly countrified; there's a rock-virtuosity tribute to Jeff Beck, and Rugged Individual is almost a reassuring ballad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 354321680|2009-10-22T21:32:13|a68072e2549d550c8a82d5a4e110b7a9150b8389 --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Since his 2007 debut album, Ben Hudson has lost his Library but gained Kanye West, credited here as executive producer. West has even declared Hudson to be "potentially one of the most important artists of his generation", which is a little unfair on this perfectly amiable singer. Hudson may be a
            decent, Stingish vocalist and a distinctive lyricist (especially when serenading his ex-girlfriend, as on Stiff Upper Lip: "Now I'm walking back to our place, which is soon to be your place/ Throwing my shit in bin bags"), but it's far too early to make predictions. The No 2 hit Supernova and new single White Lies bode well, showing what he can do with a tune and a computer, but West is forever adding clunky raps where they're not wanted and diverting the spotlight from Hudson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 354316812|2009-10-22T21:32:13|a74f39f20ed8fed915938a1b227c1110ebfbd81c --&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Erlend Øye and Eirik Glambek Bøe have one of those time-defying relationships that are unaffected by separation. It's been five years since they released an album as Kings of Convenience, yet it could be five minutes, so restfully familiar are the murmured harmonies, autumnal guitar melodies and wisps of violin. The wor
          ld around them hasn't stood still, however: specifically, it has seen the rise of comedy folk duo Flight of the Conchords. The rippling guitar and vocal phrasing in Mrs Cold and Me in You are so reminiscent of the Conchords that an innocent line such as "there's a little bit of me inside you" seems laden with innuendo. At least these songs have an attractive, breezy lightness, unlike the second half of the album, which sounds maudlin and burdened by the desire to express something profound. Ironically, the duo's chief preoccupation is the ravages of time: perhaps those periods apart unsettle them after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 354318350|2009-10-22T21:32:13|7b8102c3bf23b683f934c62ce0e8c0e3f912be3c --&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Even if the commercial golden period being enjoyed by British urban music turns out to be fleeting, Londoner Taio Cruz should still be around in 10 years. It's not that his well-groomed electro-R&am
          p;amp;B is particularly special, but that he's got a thriving parallel career as songwriter/producer to the likes of Justin Timberlake and Usher. As an artist himself, he's proficient but generic, as typified by his performance on Break Your Heart. The song was catchy enough to have spent three weeks at No 1, but those autotuned vocals could have been anyone's, and this facelessness is a problem Cruz rarely surmounts. An exception is Dirty Picture, where he saves the day with British humour by impersonating a camera ("Snap, snap, click!"). On the plus side, Cruz's tunes are big and bumptious; the Tinchy Stryder collaboration, Take Me Back, especially so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 354319534|2009-10-22T21:32:13|338678468c379c4f1280b5d3796568eb83a756c8 --&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;The last time we heard from Whitney Houston, on 2002's Just Whitney, she was furiously denying there was anything up with her. Seven years and a visit to rehab later, the ravages are clear. Her vocals are rougher, although that isn't always a problem, particularly if you found the kind of ballad in which her voice battered you like a gale-force wind difficult to stomach. There's a bit of that here, particularly on I Didn't Know My Own Strength, as well as a few recriminations - on Nothin' But Love, she decries "haters", who presumably forced her at gunpoint to take drugs, play an imaginary piano during the 2000 Oscar rehearsals, etc - but otherwise the album concentrates on reinstalling Houston, never resident at R&amp;amp;B's cutting edge, as an unchallenging pop-soul diva. This it does with style, weaving flashes of eurodisco thump around hooky melodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report an

Unfortunately, that song was on their previous album, All We Could Do Was Sing, and without that burst of vigour Threadbare is a little underpowered - it's full of strong supporting performances, but lacks the defining moment to pull it together. Leap Year is nearly there, and Calm Me Down is a pleasing ballad a la Band of Horses, but one yearns for the song that demands attention instead of diffidently wondering if, perhaps, you would care to listen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 354316456|2009-10-22T21:32:13|aed75af9e50129794fd69c68d976bbe12afa72a8 --&gt;</body>

          &lt;p&gt;Welsh musician Huw Warren doesn't often work in London, so the word isn't out about him as much as it should be. But he's a fine co
          mposer and a very classy jazz improviser on both piano and accordion. Mingling Warren's own playing and writing with half an album's worth of scintillating pieces by Brazilian genius Hermeto Pascoal is therefore surefire chemistry - and the presence of Austrian double bassist Peter Herbert and drummer Martin France makes incandescence all the more inevitable. Warren intersperses his own music with Pascoal's, and though the originals are looser and at times more abstract, they reflect both the pair's shared mischievousness and sense of mystery. The cascading, long-lined tune of Harmonia sem Chronologia, the glowing romanticism of Desencontro Certo and the glittering dance of Jegue are irresistible Pascoal pieces that are worth the price of the album. But since Warren and his trio add so much more, it's an even better deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 354321385|2009-10-22T21:32:13|c8

            p&gt;Anyone who owns "Seasick" Steve Wold's 2008 breakthrough album I Started Out With Nothin' and I Still Got Most of It Left won't gain too much from the follow-up. Wold's wheezing vocal still sounds as if he washed whisky down with dust, and he hasn't suddenly started singing about scoring a top 10 hit or packing them in at the Royal Albert Hall. His lyrical concerns are still rooted in a life he had left behind even before he became successful - it's certainly hard to imagine him spending too many days riding public transport now, as he does on Just Because I Can, or riding his tractor all day long (Big Green and Yeller). However, he remains devoted to his craft, playing and singing about bits of wood with one string attached (Diddley-Bo). The line "When I walk down the street I feel like a man from another time" sums up his drive and his appeal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark

            &lt;p&gt;When Davy Graham died last December, the British folk scene lost one of its most extraordinary and influential guitarists, for he was years ahead of his time. He was fascinated by traditional music, but also by blues, north African, Middle Eastern and Indian styles, and classical music. It was impossible to guess what he would turn to next, and he brought a new experimental approach to the folk scene that persists today. This new two-CD set concentrates on his most creative period, the 60s, and much comes from the Decca catalogue. It starts with the original 1963 version of his best-known guitar piece, Angi (later rerecorded as Anji). There are also tracks from his influential 1965 album, Folk, Blues &amp;amp; Beyond, which includes everything from Mingus to Dylan, and from the experimental Folk Roots, New Routes, recorded with singer Shirley Collins. Then there's his treatment of a Bulgarian dance piece, a Purcell harpsichord work, an
            d the extraordinary She Moved Thru' the Bizarre, which switches from English folk song to a raga, and then back again. The man was a genius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 354321043|2009-10-22T21:32:13|0a018abfe6be0fbb58a28584b3d35862639b6a84 --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Stan Tracey's drummer on Senior ­Moment (and on over three decades' worth of earlier moments) is his son Clark, whose freewheeling enthusiasms for the gospelly bebop of Art Blakey get their chance to stretch out on this album by his latest band. Clark's ­music sounds a little more in awe of its ­American ­antecedents than his father's does. But the playing is spirited, and so is the ­material, which mixes originals with classics such as Wayne Shorter's One By One and ­Thelonious Monk's Bemsha Swing. Tracey's unfussy, ­propulsive drumming, the ­purposeful bop ­vibraphone-playing of Lewis Wright, and the promising ­trumpet/sax ­partne
            rship of newcomers Paul ­Jordanous and Piers Green generate plenty of sparkle. But the most memorable improvisation on this session comes from Kit Downes. The former Empirical pianist undams ­barline-leaping torrents of melody, egged on by left-hand nudges and slurs (particularly on the freeform ­Devil's Chair) that testify to his world-class stature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353989340|2009-10-22T21:32:13|aa143ee85bc7f38c889605bc8b6e62cc4ef7309c --&gt;

            milar to half the other dance-pop singles in this week's chart, but nobody else is singing lines such as "I'm starting to feel just a little abused, like a coffee ­machine in an office", or howling at the end of the verses. When she snorts "Hope your room smells and the toilet doesn't flush" on Mon Amour, it's with an incongruous, Andrea Corr-ish warble of joy. But even that's not as unsettling as her rhapsodising about sex on the bouncy R&amp;amp;B track Why Wait.

            &lt;p&gt;Anyone who has seen the remarkable ­Italian pianist Stefano Bollani at work (and there'll be a four-day ­opportunity during next month's London jazz ­festival) might recall his fondness for the surreal, and his cavalier deconstructions of respected idioms. But this trio set finds Bollani in heads-down mode, playing in a m
            ore Brad Mehldau-like manner in his six-year-old ensemble with the Danish bass/drums partnership of ­Jesper ­Bodilsen and Morten Lund. Like Mehldau, Bollani loves tunes that sound sung, and builds increasingly ­intricate improvisations over ­steadily pulsing grooves from preoccupied ­beginnings. But he's more relaxed than Mehldau: some of his ­variations are ­almost absentmindedly ­delivered, ­trickling down the keyboard's length as if he'd tipped them from a bottle. There are thoughtful originals from Bollani and Bodilsen here, but also an ­absorbing programme drawing on ­Caetano Veloso (the ballad Dom de Iludir), ­Jobim (Brigas Nunca Mais, a ­superb all-round group performance) and Francis ­Poulenc, with the latter ­meditation ­highlighting ­Bollani's ­startling harmonic ­imagination. His natural playfulness might be disguised here, but it is present all the same. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardi

            &lt;p&gt;Legacy bands working over the trademark scores of famous old jazz orchestras can often simply send you in search of the original recordings. This one shows exactly how remakes should be done. The great swing bandleader died in 1984, but several of his side men are in the tribute band – and this exuberant set mixes new material with old, ­featuring pianists Hank Jones and Geri Allen, the singers Jon ­Hendricks, Nnenna Freelon and Janis Siegel, and even a couple of guest appearances from Britain's Jamie Cullum. The veteran Hendricks guests for a novelty scat ­feature on a roaring blues-swinger of a finale, but Freelon and Siegel are ­blazingly soulful jazz/blues performers in the tradition of the Basie Orchestra's vocalists of the past, and introduce some contemporary R&amp;amp;B twists to help this already sparkling set sound fresher. Cullum is convincing on Blame It On My Youth, and ends up on a hauntin

              &lt;p&gt;There was much scratching of heads last week when this 18-year-old north ­London grime MC, who is barely four singles into his career, beat Dizzee ­Rascal to the best hip-hop act award at the Mobos. If Chipmunk doubts his ­worthiness, though, he's concealing it; I Am Chipmunk is as confident as its ­title.  He has loaded the album with ­skittering, rapid-fire pop songs, leaving little room for anything hardcore. The bleepy Man Dem, a joint effort with Tinchy Stryder, may engage grime fans with its advice to would-be gangsters ("If you're a bad man, be a bad man/If you're an idiot, don't take the bad-man part"),
              but ­Diamond Rings, with its delicious ska sample, and the lovelorn-but-exultant Oopsy Daisy are aimed straight at the mainstream. That Mobo may have been premature, but this debut is a ­commendable ­opening shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353996459|2009-10-22T21:32:13|49bbee1199c91418f214986ef1df7df40bdf332e --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Lully is so closely associated with French opera at the court of Louis XIV that we tend to forget he was born in Florence, and that he cut his compositional teeth on small-scale Italian-­language ­entertainments at a time when ­Cardinal ­Mazarin, also Italian, was still a major ­dictator of French taste. This beautiful disc gathers some of the finest of them together, along with a handful of Italian
            numbers written for insertion into such major French-language scores as Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme and Psyché. The earlier pieces are overly influenced by Cavalli, and there's nothing here of the ceremonial ritual and cosmic politics we find in Lully's finest mature works. What is striking, however, is that almost from the beginning he gave equal weight to dance and song – a feature that separates his work from operas written for performance in Italy. Also in evidence here is that wonderful mixture of invention and structural tautness that is typical of everything he wrote. La Risonanza's classy performances are ­directed from the harpsichord by Fabio Bonizzoni. Emanuela Galli, sounding ravishing, has the lion's share of the ­vocal numbers; there are also fine contributions from Yetzabel Arias Fernández and ­Stefanie True. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353991565|2009-10-22T21:32:13|40

            &lt;p&gt;While most ­divas have been ­marking the 250th ­anniversary of Handel's death with recitals of opera arias, French ­soprano Sandrine Piau has turned to the composer's oratorios for a disc that ranks among the most beautiful things you're likely to hear all year. The underlying theme is the power of music both to convey ­human suffering and to release us from it: Piau contrasts the ­agonies of such martyred heroines as Theodora, and Cleopatra in Alexander Balus, with arias of redemption or consolation from Joseph and his Brethren, Messiah and La Resurrezione. More than ever, we are reminded that there are no dichotomies between spirituality and sensuous pleasure in Handel, and one hesitates even to describe this as an album of ­sacred music, since Piau also includes substantial extracts from works more philosophical than religious, such as L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato. Whether letting fly at some of
            Handel's most vertiginous coloratura or spinning out long threads of exquisite, silvery sound, her singing is sensational – never more so than in the closing track, Tu del Ciel Ministro Eletto from Il Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno. It is one of the greatest passages in all music, and this is the most remarkable performance of it that I know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353990937|2009-10-22T21:32:13|77a5aec88fd64d72c82e3b767cc55f47644631b9 --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;"The first German-Hungarian-Gypsy-Swiss-Austrian symphony" is how Iván Fischer gawp-inducingly describes Brahms's First in a sleeve note that ­reflects on its protracted genesis and the multiplicity of influences that ­informed it. As with many of Fischer's discs of
            late, the main work is subjected to a process of contextualisation, so the First is prefaced by Hungarian Dance No 14 and the Variations on a Theme by Haydn, which are held up as examples of the Romantic elegance and classical leanness that merge in the symphony. The point is a common one and has been better made, but the performances are so mind-blowing that Fischer's didacticism doesn't really matter. Ever the radical, he effectively refashions each work from scratch. The Haydn ­Variations have a grace and lightness of touch we don't often hear in them. The First, meanwhile, is monumental in every sense of the word: a huge, noble assertion of the inherent dignity of human experience and ­creative endeavour that leaves you feeling enriched and exalted. We're not told whether this marks the start of a major new Brahms ­cycle, though we must hope it does.

            &lt;p&gt;The 19th studio album from Kiss – their first for 11 years – sees them boasting of a return to their classic 70s sound. That's all well and good, but their classic 70s sound was little better than their rather iffy 80s sound, or their downright ropey 90s sound. The lumpen worst this time out comes from Gene Simmons, whose musical ingenuity is matched only by his lyrical acuity. Yes I Know (Nobody's Perfect) manages to pull off effortless charmlessness; Hot and Cold, presumably for a bet, issues an invitation to "feel my tower of power". Paul Stanley's rock-as-motivational-address anthems fare a little better, but there's precious little ­inspiration. So All for the Glory comes as a thorough surprise: it's pop-metal, like the rest, but a little more urgent, erupting into a joyfully preposterous choral refrain that's just irresistible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported

            &lt;p&gt;This album is dedicated to 82-year-old pianist Stan Tracey's wife, Jackie, who died in August. She helped guide his career and anchor his sometimes unstable life, so it's fitting that this album both revisits past compositional landmarks and presents his family-­celebrating Grandad Suite for the first time. Tracey never makes contorted efforts to unveil new styles, and this quartet set (with saxophonist Simon Allen) ostensibly ­follows familiar routes in its ­variations on the sax/piano trio ­approach of ­Thelonious Monk. Allen, the latest in a long line of gifted Tracey saxophone ­recruits, brings a searing urgency to the typically lurching Afro-Charlie Meets the White Rabbit, and Duffy's Circus is a classic Tracey ballad in which the chord turns are punched home but the impression is affectionate. Triple Celebration is like a Sonny Rollins calypso, Stemless a sassy bop blues, and the four-part ­Gr
            andad Suite a mix of wistfulness and pushing swing, with Allen injecting an ­anthemic soul-jazzy heat (an unfamiliar ­ingredient for a Tracey album) on the gently ­hustling Benology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353989037|2009-10-22T21:32:13|ce13acb225ffdb6a9666679d6d4f9d37d1c5c80d --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Best known for their collaboration with Steve Earle on his song City of ­Immigrants, Forro in the Dark are ­Brazilian expats who have taken the ­rural music of Brazil's north-east and ­reworked it for the club scene in New York, where they mostly perform. Forro may not be as well known to ­western audiences as samba, but it's one of the great dance styles of Brazil, as shown by the more traditional forro tracks that kick off the album. The light, ­insistent rhythms are driven on by the deep zabumba drum, and the ­instrumentation includes guitars and the pifano flute
            , with some furious solos from Jorge Continentino. Played loud, this is wonderful party music, but the band use old-style forro simply as their starting point. Their new-style forro includes the breathy, half-spoken Silence Is Golden, with vocals by Sabina Sciubba of New York's Brazilian Girls (who are, of course, not Brazilian). And there's the ­final, laid-back Just Like Every Night, a gently stomping ­hangover song, in ­English, ­featuring impressive guitar work from Guilherme Monteiro. I ­suspect they sound even better live. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353986129|2009-10-22T21:32:13|bd1fffc533be90c715446c2cf68787c2bdd960f8 --&gt;

              whole new group. It's been four years since their debut album and, based on this evidence, Stockdale has spent most of the time playing Guitar Hero and ­listening to Led Zeppelin's Physical ­Graffiti. His Robert Plant-style yelping cuts through a haze of beer-chugging riffs. There's no shame in harking back in rock time, but if you're going to ­plunder the land of hot licks, best follow the lead of the White Stripes than, say, Jet. Cosmic Egg is the sound of a serious lack of invention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353994562|2009-10-22T21:32:13|b53649b26a767c6899ff3b433e951693aac6a6eb --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The Miserly Knight, the latest instalment of Gianandrea Noseda's Rachmaninov retrospective with the BBC Philharmonic, is among the dodgiest of operas. The subject i
            s greed, and Rachmaninov's ­depiction of a miserly baron has been held in some quarters to be an important contribution to our understanding of the psychology of avarice. Yet the work also contains a virulently antisemitic portrait of a murderous Jewish moneylender that makes any revival away from a completist context virtually ­unacceptable. Noseda conducts with his trademark mixture of intensity and ­intelligence, and there are some fine ­insights into the way Rachmaninov ­creates a mood of oppressive malignancy. Ildar Abdrazakov as the baron is sinister and sexual, if a bit young. The great ­performance comes from Misha Didyk as his son, Albert – a man as selfish as his father, but who is nevertheless pushed to despair and eventual violence by the latter's unspeakable behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353992338|2009-10-22T21:32:13|719b571a96f7d7ec713d5ff7f3458670fc171f41 -

            &lt;p&gt;It was probably a lack of ambition that prevented Jimmy Hughes from joining the top rank of 1960s soul singers. He was in the right place – Muscle Shoals, Alabama – at the right time, with a bunch of fine songwriters and musicians, and his early singles, notably the gospel-drenched Steal Away, have always been prized by connoisseurs, but his retirement in the mid-70s went ­unremarked. His versatility might also have been a hindrance, and this collection, the first of two volumes, displays a range that ran from Gary US Bonds-type ­rowdiness through suave Ben E King-style balladry to the deepest of deep soul. The breakthrough hit should have come in 1965 with the achingly melismatic lament Goodbye My Lover Goodbye, which was subjected to a Mersey Beat ­bowdlerisation by the Searchers. In its pristine state, it still, like several of these tracks, sends shivers down the spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may conta

            &lt;p&gt;"Boy Division" have grown up. Walls of guitars have been replaced by a stark, electronic sound and songs about war, God, the CIA and death. Although at times they sound as if they're straining for profundity, no one could accuse ­Editors of lacking determination. Papillon – the most familiar-sounding moment here – nods to Joy ­Division and Tubeway Army. But ­elsewhere, the band have pushed themselves, perhaps taking ­inspiration from the Blue Nile or Philip Glass: they bring in metronomic kraut­rock rhythms and, on the serene Walk the Fleet Road, a choir. You Don't Know Love, an unsettling ode to decaying ­affection, is bleakly haunting, while Eat Raw Meat = Blood Drool is addictive ­listening. Frontman Tom Smith is clearly still touchy about "living out ­second-hand cliches", but his band
            are finding their own voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353994901|2009-10-22T21:32:13|33175fa02ce514177b26ee4326a7e1defce61452 --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This was taped live at London's Royal Festival Hall last February, at the start of Esa-Pekka Salonen and the Phil­harmonia's massive examination of ­Viennese modernism. Many considered it epoch-making at the time. That it doesn't quite work on disc is owing to the recording, which finely balances orchestra and choirs, but places the ­soloists so close that it emphasises ­vocal imperfections at the expense of power and beauty. Stig Andersen's ­unsteady Waldemar and Monica Groop's tragic, if raw-sounding, Wood Dove are more detrimentally affected than Soile Isoko
            ski's ecstatic Tove, so you need to make some allowances in the first section – particularly since ­Salonen's approach to the opening love songs is notably restrained. Once we're past the halfway mark and all hell is literally breaking loose, the ­performance becomes more gripping, with some electrifying choral singing, and playing as passionate as it is ­detailed. The narrator, more satisfactorily ­recorded than the other soloists, is the great German actor Barbara ­Sukowa, and as a consequence, the ­climactic Wild Hunt of the Summer Wind is about as heart-rending as it can ­possibly get. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353993096|2009-10-22T21:32:13|85e5f0a81d19327d6811992028c3c89637e36627 --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Performing their classic album Ocean Rain last year and acquiring a new rhythm section and producer (Busted man John McLaughlin) seems to have rejuvenated the Bunnymen. Th
            eir most accessible offering in a long time sees Ian McCulloch at his most lyrically ­playful and cocksure, hovering between confessional ("I cried a fountain dry") and mischievous, and firing off one-liners as if it were the band's 80s heyday. Will Sergeant's guitar-playing is at its scintillating best, although it is piano that backs the album's most ­enduring moment, the tearily anthemic The ­Idolness of Gods. There's nothing as brooding as The Killing Moon, nor as weird as Turquoise Days – but their ­poppiest tunes since Bring On the ­Dancing Horses could win the Scouse veterans a new generation of fans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353996111|2009-10-22T21:32:13|ed6e9713e0ded09ab5bd21d8033639956d505969 --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The late Miriam Makeba had no doubt as to why young South African artists have not been as successful as ­veterans such as herself or Hugh Masekela. "It's because they want to s
            ound like ­Americans‚" she told me. "I'd like to see them develop our music and sing it their way. They think sounding ­American is ­going to take them higher, but it is not." Thandiswa Mazwai seems to have taken note. She started out with the kwaito group Bongo Maffin, and now, with her second solo album, she is developing an individual style in which American soul, reggae or just a dash of hip-hop are mixed with more traditional township jive and chanting. The best songs here are the most South African, from the powerful Thongo Lam, in which her thoughtful vocals are backed by furious chanting and minimal bass guitar, to rousing township songs such as Izilo. There are soul, funk and R&amp;amp;B ­influences, but the funky workout Vana Vevhu is used to launch an attack on the ­incidents of rape and black-on-black ­violence that have marred South Africa's development, while the soulful title track is embellished with a horn solo from Masekela himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may conta

            &lt;p&gt;Has the music industry ever seemed madder than it did following Nirvana's rise to stardom? Wrongfooted by Nevermind's success, US major labels began a goldrush, desperately signing anything "alternative", regardless of how uncommercial it might be. They signed Tad: after all, who can't see the crossover potentia
            l of a 22-stone former butcher with an album called God's Balls? They fought over Kurt Cobain-endorsed singer-songwriter Daniel Johnston, despite his problems with mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And they signed frazzled Oklahoma psychedelicists the Flaming Lips. Initially it looked like more evidence of collective insanity – but, after nearly 20 years, multiple Grammys and a string of hit albums, it seems incredibly prescient. Furthermore, it's testament to frontman Wayne Coyne's legendary passion and garrulousness that he has managed to talk a major label into various bizarre schemes: quadruple-CD sets designed to be played simultaneously, gigs at which audiences were encouraged to wear headphones, ropey Christmas films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, perusing Coyne's press release for the Flaming Lips' 12th studio album, you wonder if his passion and garrulousness might not have gone too far. He keeps enthusing about Embryonic's many "free-form jams" – surely the most dispiriting phrase in rock aside from "and
            now, the Jools Holland Rhythm and Blues Orchestra". Embryonic is a double album, a format whose worth has been debated ever since the first fan listened to side four of Bob Dylan's Blonde On Blonde amid the mounting fear that, in several weeks' time, when the police finally kicked down the front door and discovered his emaciated corpse, Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands would still be playing. "They are almost always summed up as 'would have made a better single album if only the artist could have focused themselves, edited themselves, got down to work and trimmed the fat,'" notes Coyne, before once more brilliantly incentivising the public to part with their hard-earned. "I think all of this is possibly true of our latest creation, Embryonic. I would say that we, in the course of making this record, did, on all levels, completely lose our way." That sound you can hear in the background is your local record store frantically hiring crush barriers and extra security to deal with the inevitable stampede on Emb
            ryonic's release date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, you couldn't accuse Coyne of dishonesty: Embryonic genuinely is hard work. Everything is buried beneath layers of distortion. The gloriously lush, enveloping arrangements of The Soft Bulletin or Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots have been largely boiled down to bass, percussion and the odd electronic effect. The "free-form jam" is, alas, much in evidence: on two tracks – Sparrow Looks Up at the Machine, and See the Leaves – melodic fragments that the band might ordinarily have strung together into coherent songs are instead strung out and endlessly repeated. There are several guest appearances by Thorsten Wörmann, instructor of mathematics at the University of Bonn and author of the crisply titled An Algorithm for Sums of Squares of Real Polynomials. Perhaps in a desperate attempt to counter Coyne's sales pitch, his record company have made more of another special guest, Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Karen O, although they neglect to mention her contributions largely consist
            of clicking her tongue (Gemini Syringes) and doing animal impersonations on someone's answering machine (I Can Be a Frog). At worst, it's impossible to stop yourself from checking the time-elapsed bar on your iPod with increasing desperation: how much longer is this going to go on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, you can't simply write off Embryonic as a failure. Occasionally, the shift in approach delivers something new. A collaboration with MGMT called Worm Mountain sounds more bruising and visceral than the Flaming Lips have in years. Evil, meanwhile, vaguely recalls The Soft Bulletin's Feeling Yourself Disintegrate, but with all that song's blissful ebullience drained away. What's left behind is a terrible, affecting sadness of the kind that the harrowing documentary The Fearless Freaks – with&amp;nbsp;its revelations of drug addiction, mental illness and familial dysfunction – suggested might lurk at the heart of what the Flaming Lips do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all its flaws and failings, for all that you may n
            ever feel like listening to it again, it's hard not to be perversely glad Embryonic exists. In 2009, the music industry seems pretty barmy again, what with everyone denouncing everyone else over illegal downloading, but its madness is not the wild, doomed, artistic risk-taking sort of the post-Nirvana goldrush. Most bands and labels alike have expunged everything but the safe option. Whatever else it may be, Embryonic certainly isn't that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353997586|2009-10-22T21:32:13|828bbc3c54f037f12ee544fff11f68cc3c3117a5 --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Gareth Dance music has been enjoying a purple patch of late. It certainly seems to have a lock on the charts, with Calvin Harris and Armand Van Helden's zippy productions playing a key role in Dizzee Rascal's leap to stardom.  There's also a no
            stalgia circuit beginning to emerge, with the Prodigy proving as big a draw as the headline rock acts at Reading. For anyone in the festival's mid-teen to late-20s demographic, the 90s dance explosion provided the pop of their childhood, so perhaps that has something to do with it. Or maybe the only response to hard times is to hit the clubs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even some of the bands who have ridden one of the decade's more gruelling trends – "landfill indie" – know which way the wind is blowing. Bloc Party, for example, went electronic last year and now singer Kele Okereke has popped up on the fourth album from the world's current number one DJ, Holland's trance superstar Tijs "Tiësto" Verwest. Kaleidoscope is a partially successful bid to go electro-pop, with the impressive roster of guest vocalists (Sigur Rós's Jónsi Birgisson and Nelly Furtado also appear) never quite overcoming the fluffy feel of the tunes. Fast-rising Canadian Joel "Deadmau5" Zimmerman offers a more direct, route one take on electro
            and techno with his second album For Lack of a Better Name, but it's a processed kind of fury, with all the edges smoothed away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More texture can be found on Hyperdub 5 - 5 Years of Hyperdub, the fifth anniversary compilation from the influential London label at the centre of the dubstep genre. A mix of existing releases from key players such as Burial and one-offs, like Kode9 and the Spaceape's minimalist cover of the Specials' Ghost Town, it doubles as a snapshot of the scene in general, with the prevailing atmosphere that of standing on top of a tower block at night, listening to satellite dishes rattle in the breeze. The more fluid sounds of newcomers such as Cooly G offer a sense of where the underground might be headed next, as does Glasgow's Ross Birchard, alias Hudson Mohawke, whose debut album contrives to be both idiosyncratic and soulful. The spirits of OutKast and Prince loom large, and, along with most of the albums here, it crackles with imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is n

            &lt;p&gt;If one had to sum up Lightning Bolt in two words, "awkward" and "delirious" would be as good as any. The experimental bass and drums duo from Providence, Rhode Island delight in doing things their own way, employing strategies that almost seem designed to frustrate any kind of commercial success and retain their cult reputation. These include playing gigs on the floor instead of the stage, with the audience at such close quarters that the band themselves often seem in danger of being swept away in the melee they inspire; a wayward release schedule – their previous album was released in 2005 – and a wariness towards press and promotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet because of these things, rather than despite them, they have a fanatical and devoted following. Not least because Lightning Bolt are one of the most exciting and exhilarating live bands you could ever see. They play so loud and fast
            that the distortion not only stimulates shots of pure adrenaline but rattles bones and wrinkles skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earthly Delights continues the group's penchant for elemental album titles – previous albums include Ride the Skies and Hypermagic Mountain – that match their earthy, primal, electric sound. It is also a sound that on this, their fifth album, seems as resistant to change as the forces of nature and while seemingly limited in palette, is as expansive as it is inventive. Because, beneath all the noise and fury, there are bona fide songs here, driven by giddy singalong melodies that settle into maddeningly tight runs and rhythmic loops then spin off into chasms of free-form noise. Where there are lyrics, they are usually so swamped in echo, delay and distortion that they are unintelligible. Instead, everything is focused on the extraordinary physicality of their sound: spasmodic, psychedelic, heavy, loud and life-affirming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expres

            &lt;p&gt;James Chapman, aka Maps, is yet another British laptop electro one-man band, in the mould of Calvin Harris and Theoretical Girl. He comes from Northampton, got a Mercury nomination for his 2007 debut We Can Create, and, in a great many ways, has no distinguishing features in a UK pop landscape awash with arty 80s-influenced synth revivalists. Except for one thing. His second album is a masterpiece that stands with the best - Depeche Mode, Yazoo, the Normal - o

Except for one thing. His second album is a masterpiece that stands with the best - Depeche Mode, Yazoo, the Normal - of the Mute label's electro-pop past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning the Mind is inspired by a strand of behavioural therapy, pioneered by US psychologist Marsha M Linehan, which attempts to blend cognitive therapy with the "mindfulness" meditation techniques of Buddhism. Or, to put it crudely - Be Here Now. Being a fan of Jason Pierce's Spiritualized, Chapman has chosen to mix this heady Zen therapy theme with a cocktail of drug references. Add bitter break-up lyrics, a truckload of twinkly 80s synths, a sense of hymnal melody pinched from European classical music, whispery harmonies, and beats borrowed from 90s shoegazing indie and Balearic disco, and you have a record that sounds like Pierce, the P
            et Shop Boys and Dutch trancemeister Ti&amp;euml;sto getting head-shrunk while tripping on a beach in Ibiza. There's a song called Valium in the Sunshine, just to punch the point home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In anticipation, perhaps, of accusations of being pretentious and drug-addled, Chapman gets his rebuttals in early on the sky-scraping single I Dream of Crystal: "Don't get me wrong/But you can't knock what you've never done ... So get the fuck off my case." From there, Turning The Mind switches between misery, joy and bursts of anger as its dozen beautiful melodies bathe you in honey. It's the best pop album about beating depression since 1983's Soul Mining by The The.

            &lt;p&gt;I have a dream. It's that one day a glorious new dawn breaks and musicians of all races, creeds and colours will unite in the realisation that making an album of "freak-out rock jams" is, generally, not a terribly good idea. Those musicians, however, are not Oklahoma's lovable odd-bods Flaming Lips and that album is emphatically not Embryonic. "We&amp;nbsp;did, on all levels, completely lose our way," frontman Wayne Coyne admits in&amp;nbsp;the blurb accompanying their 12th record. "We surrendered to every impulsive whim… and now we stand before you not knowing what we have&amp;nbsp;done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, at least we're all clear about where we stand. Embryonic is an improvised double album not so much written as stumbled upon – and, boy, it sounds like it. Fragmented, loose, indulgent, occasionally inspired, it's considerably heavier than their last outing, 2006's At War With the Mystics, and though it
            may be high concept – a preoccupation with nature and the power of the elements meanders through the songs – it's lo-fi: fuzzy, raw and&amp;nbsp;warped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's most astonishing about a record where the overarching creative ethos is "be more free" is how narrow and homogenous much of it ends up sounding. Thunderous opener Convinced of the Hex is built upon the clattering bones of the Beatles' Tomorrow Never Knows; thunderous closer Watching the Planets (which features the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' vocalist Karen O) is… built upon the clattering bones of the Beatles' Tomorrow Never Knows. Perhaps inevitably for an album written on the hoof, there's an almost fatal shortage of stickable tunes. Embryonic is essentially a rhythmic&amp;nbsp;record, virtually every song propelled by syncopated drums&amp;nbsp;and a distorted, circular bass line while digitised bleeps and&amp;nbsp;whistles bubble in the&amp;nbsp;background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coyne still can't really sing, his wispy vocal whine drifting over
            the proceedings like fluffy cloud-cover, floating around in search of the ghost of a melody that usually isn't there. Thankfully, over 18 songs and 70 minutes some startlingly lovely moments do rise to the surface: the passage of organ music – like a post-millennial Bach fugue – in the middle of the excellent See the Leaves; the touching Evil and its counterpoint If, both nodding towards the symphonic beauty of Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots; and the way the ominous, expectant Powerless (which sounds a bit like Led Zeppelin's No&amp;nbsp;Quarter) slides into an insistent, nagging guitar solo, like a finger worrying away at a throbbing tooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their much-vaunted pop sensibility and beguiling disingenuousness are not entirely absent, either. Silver Trembling Hands is a sparkling jewel, and where else would you find a giggling Karen O pretending to be a bear, bat, cat, wolf, helicopter, locust and frog on a song called – oh yes – I Can Be a Frog? Embryonic is certainly not without charm, but it
            s title gives the game away. Largely, it's the sound of a band seeking inspiration rather than finding it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353731053|2009-10-22T21:32:13|da4e0edfd5c7754d609052235df0347c48a5ba6d --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Biffy Clyro are a three-headed hairy rock beast from Ayr. Despite their name - a nonsensical stoner in-joke - they've been stealthily making inroads into the rock mainstream for a decade. They're a product of that peculiar Scottish condition: Celtic exuberance rattling against Calvinist understatement and industriousness. Granted, the trio started life in thrall to Nirvana, but their first three albums carved an assured niche. They were cacophonous and spit-furious sets whose serpentine melodies refused to take the path of least resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relentless touring earned frontman Simon Neil and the Johnston twins, Ben and James, a hardcore fan
            base and while contemporaries such as Hell is For Heroes and Hundred Reasons calcified or withered, they cannily avoided terminal trendiness and forged on. Their fourth album, Puzzle, charted at No 2 and their singles leapt on to the Radio 1 A-list. Bankrolled by a major label and written in the wake of Neil's mother's death, Puzzle resonated with a new sense of scale: there were soaring choruses and a choir. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only Revolutions is a logical sequel and could well be Biffy's finest hour. Reaffirming their liking for proggy crypticness, they've named it after a conceptual novel by American postmodern horror writer Mark Z Danielewski. It opens dramatically with The Captain, and a cavalcade of marching feet, brass and whoops. On first listen, you fear that they've tipped over into preposterousness, but the 13 tracks avoid bloatedness while confidently casting their net wider than Puzzle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The playfulness integral to Neil's eclectic side project Marmaduke Duke is also apparent. Liste
            n to the funky strut of Born on a Horse, or the untethered falsetto on Cloud of Stink. Neil says he's moved on from the misery that stalked Puzzle, but it's apparent that grief has left him hammering out his own compromise and pondering the hereafter. The pared-back God &amp;amp; Satan sees him "talk to God as much as I talk to Satan because I want to hear both sides". His lyrical style leans towards obliqueness but, for all his empathy with the human condition, he's also well versed in a sense of its absurdity. It explains why, alongside God and love, horses are a recurrent theme and lines such as, "I like to think I'm Mr Thoroughbred", are sung with his tongue stuck firmly in cheek.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At their heart, Biffy remain hard rockers. But they corral their heavier, visceral tendencies within irresistible tunes. Bubbles has an addictive guitar line, while The Captain is a heroic singalong hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether Only Revolutions will propel Biffy Clyro into the stratosphere is another mat
            ter. It's likely that their slabs of noise are too explosive. But for Team Biffy, their followers, this is a strength, not a failing. Biffy Clyro have got this far without paying heed to populist tastes, so they needn't start now. Still, it's a woeful soul who can listen to Only Revolutions without feeling exhilarated and part of the gang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353624438|2009-10-22T21:32:13|12233659d4ac9ff2e3205d39adef88395f0f4cf8 --&gt;

And this first release on his own National Elf is a joyful encapsulation of all that he does best. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From irresistible pop singalongs (Look at My Boots) to polemical psychedelia (My Baby Joy), the reason these stylistic transitions seem so unforced is that nothing here is being done for effect.

Roll over Matt Bellamy, tell Goldie the news: the proposition that classical might be the new pop seems to be giving us an improbably good run for our money this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gear changes on this particular autobahn are swift and sometimes a little clunky. Within just over four minutes, the opening monoxide drone of Prelude on the Esplanade has already given way to the exultant Fanfare For the Hooper Heroes and thence to the Richard-Clayderman-plays-Steve-Reich ivory-tinkling of Movement 1: In the Countenance of Kings. And although the ensuing instrumental fantasia in the spirit of Aaron Copland will delight many seekers after orchestral opulence, it will also give admirers of the down-home lyrical acuity of Stevens's two best albums - Seven Swans and Michigan - further cause to rue his vaulting ambition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sufjan Stevens is a very talented singer-songwriter who seems determined to do almost anything else but write songs and sing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt

            &lt;p&gt;Warning: of the nine tracks here, only two run for less than six minutes, and both of them stretch way past five. You had better be of a patient disposition, and the album may well have been designed on the assumption that you would be listening under the influence of something to help you relax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, I have never been willing to surrender to that mode, and was a bystander back in the 1960s and early 70s when other people happily wallowed in tracks that lasted for the entire side of a vinyl album. So how come this leopard is prepared to change his spots? Partly, it is down to the beguiling vocal tone of lead singer Dallas Tamaira, which often brings to mind the sublime voice of Aaron Neville on the Neville Brothers' masterwork, Yellow Moon. But that doesn't explain
            everything because there are times when Dallas takes a back seat and leaves the musicians to carry the weight, notably on the epic Shiverman which could have easily slipped onto the soundtrack of Trainspotting alongside Born Slippy by Underworld.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has tuned into Gilles Peterson's unheralded show on BBC Radio 1 will be familiar with Fat Freddy's Drop, the reggae group from Wellington, New Zealand, whose previous album, 2005's Based on a True Story, was a Peterson favourite and voted worldwide album of the year by his listeners. For me, that album was a disappointment, lacking both clear melodies and strong lyric themes, but those problems have been resolved this time around, with the bonus of gorgeous horn arrangements. Calling them a reggae group does not do justice to the range of genres they bring together, but The Raft is a wonderful demonstration of their adventurous use of reggae studio techniques to deliver a song about survival through the challenges that lie ahead. Burning
            Spear would have been happy to sing with these horns behind him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the shortest track, Pull the Catch feels like the most obvious contender to be a single, which it was towards the end of last year.  Context is always relevant, and now it sits perfectly as the pivot of the album at track 5; as so often, Tamaira's lyric is poetic and fragmentary but I think his song is about the unconditional commitment made by the singer to defend his family and household.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you'll forgive this listener's instinct for looking for musical parallels, there are times when 70s' funk groups the Average White Band and War are fondly remembered duringThe Nod, and when the Drop become an imaginary New Orleans street band. Am I making an unwarranted assumption in thinking that the irresistible chorus of the song "something's cooking in the kitchen tonight" could infer rising temperatures in the bedroom?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, Boondigga is a great album. But who is going to play it on the r
            adio? Time to discover Gilles Peterson, 2am every Thursday on Radio 1, and online for the following seven days on the iPlayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353691676|2009-10-22T21:32:13|e7d6e7a648f0c4fa0be693abe7710dc1ca712e67 --&gt;

Sure, a combination of Latin licentiousness and English self-taught via Bob Dylan lyrics and a thesaurus means you're never quite sure the Colombian singer knows what she's saying, but third English language albu
              m She Wolf certainly supports September's announcement concerning her eight-year engagement to Antonio de la R&amp;uacute;a, the son of a former Argentinian president: "Yah! We're so ready to reproduce!" &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The title track's video sees her exploring a pink fleshy cave, then humping a cage floor. "Every night I pray that you don't knock her up/ 'Cause I still want to be the mother of your child," wails Mon Amour. "My business to love you until you've had it," asserts Good Stuff, terrifyingly. "Where are all the men in this town?/ Did they all run off when they knew that I was coming round?" demands Men in This Town. Possibly, yes. "Matt Damon's not meant for me!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere she's "like a coffee machine in an office", warns "I'm a gypsy/ I might steal your clothes and wear them if they fit me" and asks "Why wait for later/ I'm not a waiter", conjuring the unlikely image of Shakira clearing dessert and brandishing the pin machine. The music's Pharrell Williams-assi
              sted dancefloor pop; the words entirely Shakira's.

          <body type="html">
            &lt;p&gt;Mariah Carey makes a&amp;nbsp;low-key entrance – as low-key as someone in four-inch heels, bouffant hair and&amp;nbsp;lashes as lacquered as hockey sticks can do. It's 11pm and the restaurant in downtown Manhattan is almost empty. She has been filming an advert all day and has walked – walked! (an assistant points to this fact as to Jesus on water) – from her apartment around the corner. Carey seems giant, operatic in scale, diamonds at her wrist, a ring in the shape of a butterfly taking up half of one hand, which, she says, would constitute her style even if she was still a beautician in Long Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It'll be cute," she says of the advert. "It's not a&amp;nbsp;Shakespearean moment, but…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarcasm isn't something one associates with Carey. She has sold more than 200m records, had the most number one singles
            of any solo artist in the US, co-produced and written most of her material and, at 39, has been at the top of her game for 20 years. She must be very shrewd, but for some reason – rumours of mad requirements in her dressing room, her marriage to Tommy ­ Mottola, that unshiftingly winsome expression – she has never been credited with having much sense. It's mostly the tone of her output, of course: she has a&amp;nbsp;voice that could bend steel, but her videos are full of puppies and kittens and snowflakes and glitter, all that hardcore sparkle that if you watch too much of in one sitting is like being gored by a unicorn. It&amp;nbsp;comes as a surprise, then, on the evidence of the interview, that after a hard day's work she is as&amp;nbsp;hoarse and sardonic as the next person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's some rigmarole before meeting her, not from Carey's demands but from standard secrecy around her new album. A few weeks earlier, journalists and minders gathered at the record company to sit on white sofas wh
            ile her album was played to us. It was hard to find an appropriate facial expression. (Most went&amp;nbsp;for eyes half-closed: "it's striking my soul".) Later, a person from Island Def Jam came to my apartment, disabled the internet so I couldn't perform any pirating tricks and played me the second half of the album while I avoided eye contact and made vague and embarrassing efforts to look as if I&amp;nbsp;was, at some level, rocking out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new album, Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel, is the first time, Carey says, she has publicly expressed her snarky side. It is full of snippy put-downs and laconic insults. "Not even a nail technician with a whole lot of gel and acrylic can fix this," she sings about a break-up, in the song Up Out My Face. "It was something I knew women could relate to because, you know" – heavy eye-roll – "nail technicians can pretty much fix anything." She sounds like Mae West with a&amp;nbsp;hangover, and I mean that as a compliment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason
            for the shift in attitude is her 18-month-old marriage to Nick Cannon, a singer and TV personality, which, she says, has given her the security to stop being so cautious, stop biting her tongue. She is engaged, at present, in a frank exchange of views with Eminem, whose sub-Wildean put-down of Carey ("bitch/shut the fuck up") she appears to have answered in a single of her own. It would smack of a joint PR initiative, except Carey seems genuinely irritated. "He wrote a song about me and my husband, and in a really derogatory and juvenile way. And it's not up to par with his other songs." Carey's single, Obsessed, the first release from the new album, is about a sad little man who throws hip-hop shapes in his bedroom and follows her around, peering out from beneath his hoodie. "I never said it was about him. If he sees himself in that song…" But in any case, she says, "I'm not a fan. There's no connection there. I knew him, kind of vaguely, eight years ago, on a purely platonic level, and then he wasn't
            my friend any more and I was like, OK, whatever. And&amp;nbsp;this was eight years ago and he's just writing this song. For no reason. No reason."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says her husband is still saying "he is going&amp;nbsp;to slap him if he ever sees him. He boxes." She laughs. "See, the difference is, my song is on the radio and his, you have to search for it." Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Carey's attitude has sharpened, her vocal style is as it always was, compulsively dancing around the note, springboarding with no warning to the "whistle register", which only bats can really hear. It must be hard, with that range at her disposal, to resist showing off. She looks wary. "Right…?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did she have to work hard on the new album to&amp;nbsp;keep a lid on it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know if I did keep a lid on it. Do you think I went over the top?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. Maybe. A little bit. There was one song where she did suddenly leap up about five octaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I Wan
            t To Know What Love Is?" (The album closes with a great cover of the Foreigner classic).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh, it was Inseparable. Well, it's just a moment and it stops and goes into a higher register. It's just one little riff. I listen to it and go – did I go over the top? Maybe. I do a lot of background vocals in the upper register. I've always done that. Even back to Dream Lover." She sings a few bars. "Two octaves higher, but buried. You get people's attention." It's what the fans want to hear, she says, pyrotechnics. She'd be happy to tone it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high register was something she discovered as a child when her mother woke her one morning and, for comic effect, she spoke to her as if she'd just inhaled helium. "And then there was a moment in the little kitchen – a tiny house, where we lived – when I started singing like that. It's a totally different place in your voice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her mother is a classically trained opera singer who studied at J
            uilliard and made her debut at Lincoln Center. She must have noticed her daughter's extraordinary talent. What did she say? Carey smiles. "She said, 'You're going to hurt yourself.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tommy Mottola was the head of Sony who signed Carey to his label when she was still a&amp;nbsp;teenager. In 1993, she married him. The way she tells it, the&amp;nbsp;condition of fame itself sounds a lot like being&amp;nbsp;married to Mottola: infantilising, restricting, full of luxury and horrible pressures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They divorced in 1998 and have just about reached an understanding about the past, although there is a lot that still rankles. She is still annoyed, for example, that none of her friends or family talked her out of it. "No one said that this might not be right for me. I didn't really want to get married. But he was so, like, we have to get married. I ended up getting into it because of the wedding and the dress and the whole thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a 21-year age difference.
            Is it true she insisted on paying for half of their mansion on feminist principle?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh yeah," she says drily. "Quite the silly little girl, I was."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does she say that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because it was an insanely expensive house. I&amp;nbsp;had no idea what money meant. Even if I'd been told, right, ultimately it's going to cost you this amount, I wouldn't have known what that meant. When you come from nothing and you suddenly make a million dollars six months into your career, just from writing songs… I was like, wow, OK, all right, if we're going to move into a house, then I want to pay for half of it because I never felt like I owned anything when I was growing up&amp;nbsp;and I don't ever want to be kicked out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And he indulged you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He said, OK, sure. Then I got a bill for so much. It was everything, down to the lighting bills. And I wanted that. But at the end it was bad. Aaargh. We sold it for a lot less than we put into
            it. I don't know who got what. I know what I got."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He got the better deal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She smiles. "I never said that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carey's own parents divorced when she was little, and although her father materialised occasionally to take her on trips – hiking or to the races – she didn't get to know him properly until she was an adult. She is reminded of him every time she is in a restaurant and orders a second Coke, as she does now. "If we went to a restaurant, this wouldn't happen. It would be one drink. One soda. Slowly sipped, so that I wouldn't become full. That's how he was. He was tough. He'd been in the military. I do miss him. At the end&amp;nbsp;of his life we spent a lot of time together. And&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;learned a lot about his side of the family."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her mother grew up in the midwest. "She came from – er –?" Carey frowns. "Middle of America?" She brightens –"Illinois!" – and as such, she says wryly, "is among the whitest people I kn
            ow". Her father was half-African American, half-Venezuelan. "I'm a black woman who is very light skinned." As a child, she was self-conscious of her mixed race, and it is still enough of an issue, in the US and elsewhere, that Carey is routinely accused of "trying too hard" in one racial direction or another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"White people have a difficult time with [mixed race]. It's like, my mother's white – she's so Irish, she loves Ireland, she's like, yay, Ireland! Waving the flag and singing When Irish Eyes Are Smiling. And that's great. I appreciate that and respect it. But there's a whole other side of me that makes me who I am and makes people uncomfortable. My father identified as a black man. No one asked him because he was clearly black. But people always ask me. If we were together, people would look at us in a really strange way. It sucked. As&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;little girl I had blond hair and they'd look at me, look at him, and be disgusted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says she "needs to t
            alk" to&amp;nbsp;Obama about this. When he&amp;nbsp;became president, she was overwhelmed and delighted, "but for years we never believed it would happen. There's a group who will never get it, never want to get it. Because you have to lose the purity of both races and there are certain people who really don't want that to happen. I think it starts with people teaching their children that it's not OK, because they don't want their kid to come home with someone of another race. I understand people want to hold on to their roots. But for me, I was a complete nonentity because of it. Maybe that was part of my drive to succeed. I'll become accepted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now? Oh, she says, sarcastically, "it's in vogue now. So I'm sitting here thinking, now it's cool, great."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carey's father left her no money in his will: "He considered me independently wealthy, so it wasn't about his money, which he had quite a lot of, surprisingly." What he left her was his car. "His car was this big th
            ing to him. It was a Porsche from 1937 or something. He used to drive it around Brooklyn Heights, where my parents met. When I&amp;nbsp;was little, I remember him always working on the car. I got the car. I'm fixing it up. It looks beautiful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her parents' marriage ended, Carey and her mother moved 13 times before settling in a&amp;nbsp;neighbourhood in Long Island, where her mother had several jobs. She was encouraged to sing; her mother said "not if but when" in regard to her daughter's ambitions, but didn't push her, says Carey, which was just as well, because "I really rebel against authority. Which is ironic, judging by some of the relationships I've had." Her father told her to concentrate on her maths homework and her teachers said her ambitions were "pipe dreams". As a teenager, Carey worked at a restaurant during the day and went to a studio at night, where she wrote songs and recorded until seven in the morning, "slept a couple of hours", and started again. Musician f
            riends in their mid-20s looked on in amazement. "Why are you working so hard?" they asked. She looked at them, she says, loafing about in the middle of the day, and thought: "Because I&amp;nbsp;don't want to be like you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her debut album, Mariah Carey, spawned four number one singles; when the title single from her second album, Emotions, went to number one, it was the only time an artist in the US had achieved five number ones, back to back, with their first five singles. But Carey didn't "feel famous", she&amp;nbsp;says, because Mottola had her more or less "sequestered" at their house in the country. It got worse when they married. "Suddenly I was the Wife and I was supposed to be appropriate. But I&amp;nbsp;was still too young to be appropriate." At weekends she wanted to go out with her friends in the&amp;nbsp;city, "not go and look at foliage". She smiles. "I appreciate foliage now. But that wasn't what I&amp;nbsp;wanted to do after doing a video or whatever. You want to go
            out a little bit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wasn't he just trying to protect her?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I guess. When you see what happens to some people, I could've been a wild mess. And I think that's what [he] was avoiding." But she ended up feeling like a child. "It was like, come on, you're going here. Or here. And maybe you can have a&amp;nbsp;friend come, one time. Every two months. That's just an overview. That's my little – what should we call it? – recollection of life back in the day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the marriage ended, she lived in hotels for a couple of years. She had built their marital home from scratch and didn't have the heart to start another one. The only things she took away from it were "my childhood photos and little things like that. I didn't bring any of the material things. So that right there was stupidity. Or naivety. I thought, let me just be free."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the turn of the millennium, after a solid decade of success, she had her first professional catastrophe. Th
            e film Glitter, autobiographical and with a companion album of the same name, was one of the most mocked films ever released. She must have thought herself impervious to failure by&amp;nbsp;that stage. "Er. Honestly? It was a failure, but…" Carey got undue flak, she thinks, because it came out on 11 September and also because dark forces (unrelated) considered her overdue for a comedown. "I've seen other artists put out movies that went straight to DVD and no one cared. Maybe their own fans bought the thing and that was fine. But there was so much – so much attention paid to me, and there were certain people who shall remain nameless who wanted so much negative press for me. Because I'd gotten away with it [until then] without being crushed by the media."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The backlash was vicious; her stage style, her preoccupation with shiny things and all the cute motifs. Carey huffs: "People are like, what is your whole obsession with butterflies? I'm like, I'm not&amp;nbsp;obsessed. I like them. Can'
            t anybody like something?" She dismisses the period as being similar to the time she got a grain of sand in her eye when she was four – "I'm over it" – and she pulled out of it with her 10th album, the critically successful The Emancipation Of MiMi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carey is now tentatively getting back into acting. In a film about to be released, she plays Miss Weiss, a Harlem social worker, a role so bedraggled and against type it looks like a bulwark against the memory of Glitter. Precious, adapted from the novel Push, by Sapphire, is about an obese, abused teenager who is saved by&amp;nbsp;a literacy programme and the efforts of her beleaguered social worker. It won an audience prize at Toronto last month and has been championed by Oprah. The casting of Carey smacked of gimmickry, but after you recover from the shock of her with lank hair and no sequins, she is good; convincingly frustrated and keening with the misery of her caseload. She eschews the usual actressy spiel about substance over style and
            cries, "I looked so damn ugly! Those little bangs and then he [director Lee Daniels] put the dark circles under my eyes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was that her moustache or did they shade it in?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No. He did that." She looks thoroughly traumatised. "He was very excited about that. I&amp;nbsp;just kept away from mirrors. I had to do the inner work to be this character. There was a moment where I was trying to sneak on blusher, and he caught me and I said, 'But Precious has make-up on!' I've always been very insecure about my looks, anyway. Having led such a public life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mother in the film is played by Mo'Nique, and Precious by a brilliant unknown actor called Gabourey Sidibe. Carey's toughest scene was in a conference with both of them, as they screamed at each other and "I attempt to be stoic. In between takes we were hugging and crying. In my mind I thought, she can't cry in front of them, they'll have the upper hand and she won't be able to do her job." The director t
            old her his first choice for Miss Weiss had been Helen Mirren, who it's hard to imagine in the part, but Carey says, "Don't you think she could probably do anything? Anyway, that was overwhelming."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one stage, the racial politics of the film tack deliberately in Carey's direction: the director added a scene in which Precious quizzes her social worker over "what she is" exactly – Greek, Jew, Hispanic? "Yeah, I've had that a few times." The insecurity she traces to looking different as a&amp;nbsp;child has stayed with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more successful Carey has become, the harder, one imagines, it has been for her to get an honest opinion out of anyone. "Um. Yeah." She thinks about it. "Although I have friends in the industry who are like, well, I'm gonna be the one that tells her the truth." She smiles. "That becomes annoying."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if she's being a jerk, someone will tell her?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She looks surprised. "I try not to be a jerk. I&amp;nbsp;re
            ally do. I try to be nice and cordial. I've seen the real extreme diva behaviour and I don't think that's who I am. I&amp;nbsp;think I have mannerisms and that whole thing, and I'm running around in these shoes. But even before I had any type of fame, I&amp;nbsp;was like this." She laughs. "Seriously."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so finally, then, to the question of dressing rooms and rumours that have been around for ever. Has she ever asked for kittens or puppies as accessories backstage? "No. In a video maybe." Bowls of blue M&amp;amp;Ms? "I don't even eat them." And the carpet thing? "Yeah. They said I wouldn't come into a hotel unless there were petals on the floor. I'm like, do you really think at 3am I give a&amp;nbsp;shit what I'm walking on?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She hoists herself up, mighty in heels, and cleaves across the room. At another table is debris from a birthday party that, earlier in the evening, had stopped Carey mid-sentence. "That's so pretty," she said absent-mindedly, looking across
            the restaurant. "I love sparklers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; • Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel is out on November 16; the film, Precious, is out in February 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353580126|2009-10-22T21:32:13|d3734597ddb9248c1e8245fdc68fd7cb7aad6d9b --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;When she released La Juderia four years ago, it was clear that Yasmin Levy had the makings of a world music superstar. After all, she's a good looking young Israeli singer with an exquisite and passionate vocal style, and a bravely original musical mission. She set out to revive the Ladino language and the songs of the Jews who were expelled from Spain in the late 15th century and dispersed around the Mediterranean, and to match their music against her love for flamenco. Her last album, two years ago, was a triumphant combination of those styles, with instrumentation from the Arab world. This new set tries to be even bolder in scope, but it i
            s hampered by the technically skilled but often bland and lukewarm backing from her new set of musicians. Her voice is as fine and powerful as ever, especially on her gutsy duet with the Greek singer Elani Vitaly on the flamenco-tinged Porque, and on an exquisite treatment of the Ladino ballad Una Postora, in which her voice is matched against an old recording of her father, a fine singer who died when she was one year old. But against that, there's the overlush piano work on Triste Vals, and the insipid guitar work on a curious easy-listening, flamenco-tinged Spanish-language treatment of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah. She deserves better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353694500|2009-10-22T21:32:14|63d623ae0a14e9fa7af818ae2f0df98210647d33 --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Former Miles Davis guitarist Mike Stern is a formidable player in most contemporary styles - but unlike John Scofield, Bill Frisell or Pat Metheny, he never sounds as if he's figured out which one works for him. Not that he has to, or that the most eclectic of mixes can't make it, but while there's some superb playing here (from Stern, and guests Richard Bo
            na, Medeski, Martin and Wood, Randy Brecker, Cindy Blackman and Esperanza Spalding), Big Neighbourhood sounds a bit like box-ticking across the successful formulae of other musicians. Stern's full-on rock blast on the title track with fellow guitarist Steve Vai has a raw-boned, if somewhat Spinal Tap-like exhilaration; the African shuffle Reach (with Richard Bona) is a light and playfully engaging groove; and bassist/singer Spalding lends a delicious jazz-vocalese lilt to a couple of episodes for a small group that also features Cindy Blackman on drums. Stern's graceful lines and warm tone work well on the ballads, but by the time the chattering melody of Moroccan Roll has distractingly brought John McLaughlin's eastern exploits to mind, and the Medeski, Martin and Wood collaboration Check One has done the same for John Scofield, Stern's identity recedes somewhat. There's plenty here for guitar buffs, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are no

            &lt;p&gt;Lethal is back. And he's got unfinished bizzle: at least three times he reminds us that he's returning with a third solo record. But rather than Going Hard as the title intones, the Walthamstow MC continues on the pop-ish bent of 2007's Back to Bizznizz and features the king of quacking brass sections himself, Mark Ronson, plus an unimaginative take on House of Pain's Jump Around. It's actually the Ronson track, Lost My Mind, featuring a great violin riff, that stands out here among Bizzle's self-aggrandisement. This album works best when it does what it implores and makes its beats go four to the floor: a heavy take on Salt-n-Pepa's Push It is among the best things here. But this is a record let down by odd decisions, chief among them being an awful slowed-down vocal effect that acts as its recurring motif.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which

            &lt;p&gt;A long way from Canada's other big musical exports like Arcade Fire and Bryan Adams, Deadmau5 (pronounced "dead mouse"), aka Joel Zimmerman, is a progressive house/electro producer from Toronto making waves. His 2008 hit I Remember generated 11m MySpace plays, and he was such a draw at the Reading festival that very few could get near the stage to see him performing in a giant rodent's head. Although this is a stopgap compilation of his productions, his music similarly injects a bit of personality into what can be anonymous club sounds. His berserk mixes could easily feature the kind of progressive keyboard sounds that ELP's Keith Emerson once made by attacking an organ with a knife, or veer into The Death March. Although his piano gets thoughtful on occasions, he's never far from speaker-rattling bass grooves, guaranteed to move the feet and make you very unpopular with the neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which a

            &lt;p&gt;Fuck Buttons - or F*ck Buttons, according to their rather prudish press r
            elease - are two guys, Andrew Hung and Benjamin John Power. Adored by a certain kind of Pitchfork-reading indie fan, their second album's long, trance-inducing instrumentals nod to techno, noise and even the current shoegaze revival. This music, however, creates the Sagrada Fam&amp;iacute;lia of sonic cathedrals: beautiful, organic and prone to sprout weird and wonderful tentacles of sound. It's not the surface-level sonic sorcery that moves you here, but the melancholic undertow, a sense of sadness that washes over tracks such as The Lisbon Maru, surely a new market standard bearer when it comes to sad electronic songs about sinking Japanese freighters. In this sense, Fuck Buttons have less in common with the overly cerebral noise boffins they're compared to and more with the likes of Ennio Morricone: sonic explorers mapping out the landscape's emotional terrain, albeit one that exists in some far-off galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are n

            &lt;p&gt;In the late 1980s and 90s, Mitsuko Uchida recorded all Mozart's piano concertos for Philips, with Jeffrey Tate conducting the English Chamber Orchestr
            a. This time, though, Uchida is directing the performances herself from the keyboard - live recordings from concerts in Cleveland's Severance Hall last December. Admirers of Uchida's fabulously fluent Mozart playing will know what to expect from these accounts; every phrase is elegantly tooled, every texture perfectly weighted. The Cleveland Orchestra is currently one of the finest in the world, and it is fascinating to hear it scaling down its usually opulent sound to the almost chamber-music transparency that Uchida obviously expects. Though the major climaxes still carry a real symphonic weight, it's in the more intimate dialogues, especially in the C minor concerto, where the woodwind writing plays such an important role, that Uchida's rapport with the orchestra is so obvious. Just once or twice the tempi seem on the slow side, but that's a minor quibble in what is often a rapturously beautiful disc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not sup

            &lt;p&gt;Stigers, a Ray Charles-style soul vocalist and swinging tenor saxophonist, is currently on a long UK tour and turns to the standards book with this set. It includes My Funny Valentine, Bye Bye Blackbird and In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning, but also Annie Len
            nox's Cold and John Lennon's Jealous Guy, sustaining this former pop singer's reputation for distinctive mixes. Stigers is the kind of mainstream pop-jazz performer who could veer close to the cheesy, and his timely but rather clunky Vera Lynn tribute merging Pink Floyd's Vera and We'll Meet Again gets too close for comfort - is it possible to sing "Vera, what has become of you?" and stay cool? But for the most part, Stigers is saved by his sandpaper tones, melodic flexibility, affection for jazz's freedoms, candid delivery and muscular resolve. Cold starts privately anguished and gets defiantly funky; the piano-shadowed You've Got the Fever evokes Kurt Elling with Laurence Hobgood; Jealous Guy includes some McCoy Tyner-like piano and blazing Stigers soul-sax; and My Funny Valentine is a genuinely fresh account, with its explosive vocal wail at the close. Stigers may occupy the centre ground, but he always makes it sound like he's nourished by being there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may

            &lt;p&gt;Nikolaus Harnoncourt has already conducted studio recordings of Schumann's only opera, Genoveva, and his other major choral piece, Das Paradies und die Peri, and this account of perhaps the composer's finest, most sustained evening-long work generally maintains the high standards set by those. Scenes from Goethe's Faust has been fortunate on disc, especially an outstanding version conducted by Claudio Abbado. Abbado's soloists include Bryn Terfel and Karita Mattila, and Harnoncourt's team doesn't quite match up to them, but he does have the baritone Christian Gerhaher as a wonderfully intelligent Faust, and there are good performances from Alistair Miles, Werner G&amp;uuml;ra and M
            ojca Erdmann in smaller roles, as well as matchless orchestral playing from the Royal Concertgebouw. Harnoncourt's admiration for what is one of Schumann's greatest scores constantly shines through too, but Abbado's recording remains the one to get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353695910|2009-10-22T21:32:14|333b9bba2537f6ea1d82c266d37bd0d17278147e --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;A Glaswegian friend once told me that the Scots have 40 words for rain - and most of them are evoked over the course of this dreich second album from Kilsyth's Twilight Sad. It's heavy with lashing storms, exemplified by Made to Disappear, which offers a 1980s synth melody where lightning might flash, and That Birthday Present, in which Mark Devine's furious drums collide thunderously with Andy MacFarlane's effects-laden guitar, and James Graham's vocals fall in steady, oppressive sheets. Scissors, an instrumental, conjures up a milder meteorological effect, shimmering as gently as mizzle illuminated by street lamps. The tempestuous atmosphere is too imposing not to impress; and yet, this i

            &lt;p&gt;Fans of the late Esbjorn Svensson's influential trio are likely to own the albums on which this retrospective draws - starting with 1999's From Gagarin's Point of View, and ending with Leucocyte, which was released after the Swedish pianist's death in a diving accident last year. But for those who missed the EST phenomenon, this 13-track set visits most of the landmarks. Svensson's populist genius lay in a knack for simple but arresting melodies, shrewd mixes of jazz improv with pop and rock effects, and an instinct for the slow-burn that drops hints of a climax to come. The tranquil melody and distant electronics of From Gagarin's Point of View shows EST's promise; the funk of G
            ood Morning Susie Soho reveals Svensson's Jarrettish solo development, and the one-voice empathy of the trio; Viaticum and Seven Days of Falling are classic piano-jazz ballads given contemporary colours; and Leucocyte suggests the heavier, more abstract electric sound of EST's next phase. Only the group's pre-1999 music, reflecting the influence of Thelonious Monk among others, is missing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353697194|2009-10-22T21:32:14|0a967c7ac36097a450d52f33c6fc888fa73a6dfa --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Alina Ibragimova's previous discs for Hyperion have all been of 20th-century repertoire - concertos by Hartmann and Roslavets, violin-and-piano works by Szymanowski. All in their different ways were first rate, but none of them gave any inkling of just how startlingly good Ibragimova's solo Bach recordings might be. This is an absolutely compelling set of performances, the kind that have you on the edge of your seat wondering at the freshness of it all and what she might do next. Every phrase in these familiar works seems newly minted, every bar totally alive. In her choice of
            tempi, phrasing and dynamics, Ibragimova constantly takes risks, and almost always justifies them. She comes unstuck just a few times - usually by taking passages too fast to be able to articulate them properly, as in one section of the famous chaconne that ends the D minor Partita. But the way she illuminates the different episodes of that piece, just as she gives each phrase its own colour and emphasis, is always remarkably musical. Those who like their Bach metrically correct and evenly paced might perhaps find Ibragimova's approach too improvisatory, but its sheer energy and self-belief are genuinely thrilling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353694990|2009-10-22T21:32:14|bab5eb8d0ccf966c12699ea0bbf3eb8262b93772 --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This is a remarkable and historic set of recordings with an equally remarkable history. Woody Guthrie is now rightly acknowledged as one of the greatest songwriters and folk singers in American history, and a massive influence on Dylan and Springsteen. But in April 1944, he was rather less well known. He and his friend Cisco Houston were in New York, taking a brief break f
            rom their wartime voyages with the merchant marine, when they met up with the great harmonica player Sonny Terry, then living on social security, to record songs for the Stinson label. When Stinson was later dissolved, the metal masters of the 250 tracks they had recorded were divided between two partners. But half of them disappeared, until they were unearthed in a dusty Brooklyn basement, and painstakingly converted into digital sound. The result is astonishing: now, more than 40 years on, Guthrie and his friends can be heard as never before. The clarity is extraordinary, and so are the intimacy, variety and power of Guthrie's singing and playing, switching from stirring, passionate union recruiting songs and bleak, angry ballads such as the chilling Hangknot, Slipknot, through to patriotic wartime anthems such as Tear the Fascists Down, folk songs and rousing instrumental pieces. There are old favourites such as This Land Is Your Land (which includes that controversial verse about ignoring trespassing signs
            , which most cover versions have chosen to leave out), previously unheard songs such as the witty Bad Reputation, and instrumental work-outs including Train Breakdown, which shows off Guthrie's fine guitar work and Terry's exhilarating harmonica playing.

            &lt;p&gt;Bands don't often get another chance after a bandwagon has left town, but the Raveonettes might be an exception. Six years after emerging in the garage-rock revival that made stars of Scandinavian peers the Hives, their fourth album should put them right back on the map. A pop concoction packed with twangy hooks and dreamy melodies, it sounds like a fantasy fusion of the Phil Spector-produced Ronettes and C86-era indie stars the Primitives. Laden with echo, harmonies and guitar solos, you'd never guess
            the songs carried slyly subversive sentiments such as Boys Who Rape (Should Be Destroyed), or that Bang! revels in a chorus of "The kids wanna fuck out in the street". They have clearly had a lot of fun making this record, and from the weirdly thrilling melancholy of Last Dance to the Jesus and Mary Chain-style remodel of the Rolling Stones' Heart of Stone, it deserves to be widely heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353687765|2009-10-22T21:32:14|809a6cffc54168614b40fc3b1e04efc0c361ac9c --&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Since John Abercrombie shrinks from grandstanding gesture - and favours free improvisation - he's better appreciated by fellow-guitarists including John Scofield and Jim Hall than he is by a big public. Scofield recently claimed that Abercrombie is playing better than ever, and this renewed partnership with violinist Mark Feldman and drummer Joey Baron (with 28-year-old bassist Thomas Morgan the newcomer) makes pretty good supporting evidence. All the material except for the Rodgers and Hart title track is Abercrombie's, and the set is a free-flowing, time-shifting, four-way conversati
              on more than a succession of tunes and solos. Typically, Abercrombie starts with an almost static reverie, though Sad Song and the similarly wistful title track evoke the guitarist's links with Hall. Sometimes it sounds like contemporary chamber music, but there's plenty of urgent swing: Abercrombie's long-lined, melodic invention curl irresistibly over Baron's snappy rim shots and crisp snare-fills on the jazzy Trio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353697661|2009-10-22T21:32:14|edf1281db520e6263e8b3bc59de545d0453e51ec --&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;It is quite obviously a Good Thing that the centre of gravity of young British guitar music seems to be shifting. Where 18 months ago there was a new "landfill indie" album every other week, now it's new, young British folk-pop groups offering debut albums with metronomic regularity. Mumford &amp;amp; Sons spring from the same agglomeration of musicians that has already bequeathed us Laura Marling and Noah and the Whale, and are by all accounts a delightfully rowdy and passionate live band. Why, then, does their album feel just a little bit too polit
              e? Even when the songs - as they invariably do - cut loose into the hoedown section, with bluegrass banjo underpinning acoustic guitars, strings and horns, there's the sense they are holding back. Maybe that's also what causes Sigh No More to sound a little generic: though everything here is pleasing, there's no single "Wow!" moment. Still, it's a promising start, and once Marcus Mumford develops the storytelling skills of US counterparts such as the Low Anthem, there will surely be better to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353690752|2009-10-22T21:32:14|44e387420941452eb7663ff9a5c451e2380b540f --&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;It was easy to get excited at the time, but in retrospect there was something disappointing about New Order's noughties reunion. The albums th
              ey released certainly weren't bad, but never threatened to scale the heights of Technique or Low Life. The perennially noisome figure of Billy Corgan was involved. And, somewhere along the way, New Order lost their mystique: the sense that something unsolved and impenetrable lurked at the core of even their most commercial records, the feeling that you could never confidently predict what they were going to do next: go disco? Release a football single? Turn up on the set of Baywatch? Perhaps it was something to do with the band's vastly increased media accessibility, or their elevation to mainstream national treasurehood. Out went live videos obliquely titled Taras Shevchenko and Pumped Full of Drugs, in came knockabout biopics in which Peter Hook was portrayed by Ralph Little of Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps fame. Either way, New Order appeared to have entered a comfortable, dependable middle age. You could certainly argue they'd earned it, having spent their 20s breaking enough new ground to last
              anyone a lifetime - but the sense that a certain thrill had gone was inescapable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, perhaps the only way that New Order V2.0 trumped their original incarnation was with the acrimony of their breakup. "It was a different situation 10 years ago," remarked Bernard Sumner recently. "This one's got a bit nasty." It might thus seem a little unfair to look to Hook for an assessment of his former bandmates' first album as Bad Lieutenant, especially considering that a certain trepidation attends the long-awaited debut album by his Freebass project - not merely because it's hard to work out how a band with three bass players is going to sound, but because Hook himself recently uttered the chilling phrase, "Howard Marks has done a state-of-the-world rap on one song". Nevertheless, here goes: "It's like New Order," he gruffly opined, "but without the bass." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it's tempting to end the review there, anyone interested in Bad Lieutenant's album having presumably be
              ing told pretty much everything they need to know. It's worth noting that the version of New Order that Bad Lieutenant sound like is the guitar-heavy New Order of Run or As It Is When It Was, and that the songs on Never Cry Another Tear are often noticeably better than the stuff with which New Order rounded out their final two albums, Get Ready and Waiting for the Siren's Call. There's a potency and power about Dynamo that presumably dissipated during New Order's endless squabbling, while the single Sink Or Swim might be the most vibrant pop song Sumner has put his name to since Regret. But, just as Sumner's voice occupies a unique emotional grey area between passion and diffidence, which allows him to get away with singing the kind of lyrics that in anyone else's mouth would cause a riot of derision, so Hook is probably the most distinctive-sounding bass player in recent memory: New Order fans are likely to find themselves humming imaginary Hook basslines along to most of the songs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alas, o
              n the one occasion Never Cry Another Tear ventures outside of its comfort zone, it immediately goes somewhere you wish it hadn't, namely Head Into Tomorrow, the kind of ballad Noel Gallagher produces with the dogged regularity of a Russian duplication plant knocking out shonky Harry Potter DVDs, featuring someone who can't stay because they gave it all away and now they gotta find their way etc etc. It appears to be largely the work of Bad Lieutenant's other vocalist, Jake Evans, but you still listen to it a bit slack-jawed, wondering how the people behind Thieves Like Us and Fine Time got themselves mixed up in it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That aside, Never Cry Another Tear is by no stretch of the imagination a bad album: you could argue it exists in a grand tradition of New Order side projects - Revenge, Monaco, Electronic, The Other Two - all of which sounded exactly like New Order with certain elements missing. But it's ultimately another product of New Order's comfortable middle age, in which the sound of their
              golden past gets dependably reproduced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plenty of New Order's equally middle-aged fans will be perfectly content with that. It's just hard not to wish that some of the spirit of their past - the restless, aloof, screw-you attitude that made them take risks, made them impenetrable and unpredictable - had seeped in, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353678682|2009-10-22T21:32:14|d6b4fcbeea0cfcf39daf7b8c0ab01d897a43c501 --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Alarm Will Sound is a 20-piece ensemble that has carved out a distinctive niche for itself in the US new-music scene since it was founded at the Eastman School of Music at Rochester, New York. Their repertoire ranges from rock and electronica to mainstream modernism, and the group's first disc for Nonesuch seems designed to show the breadth of those interests, as well as the technical virtuosity behind them. It's an ­exploration of rhythm and the ­multitude of ways of sampling, layering and dislocating it, as exemplified in 14 short pieces. The longest works here are Michael Gordon's Yo Shakespeare and Harrison Birtwistle's Carmen Arcadiae Mechanicae Perpetuum, utt
            erly ­different from each other and both ­superbly done, while the five quirky pieces that make up Benedict Mason's Animals and the Origins of Dance are ­interleaved with a movement from Ligeti's Chamber Concerto, pieces from the 14th and 15th century, transcriptions of two of Conlon Nancarrow's Player ­Piano Studies, and arrangements of techno and electronica by Mochipet and Autechre. It's an exuberant mix, dazzlingly well played, and a startlingly good beginning to their association with Nonesuch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353381067|2009-10-22T21:32:14|31acce7539e76c5cdb3ca3ceeff3dd1a62843a7b --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;When Hans Werner Henze returned to composing symphonies in 1983 after a 15-year break, his ambitions had shifted significantly. The years of producing ­expressionist, agit-prop works were ­behind him, and in the four symphonies Henze has composed since, he seems to have found his peace with Germany's troubled history in the 20th century and with its symphonic tradition. The Ninth Symph
            ony, first performed in 1997, ­tackled both head on: not only is it a choral work, inevitably conjuring ­associations with Beethoven's Ninth, but it is based on Anna Seghers's anti-fascist novel The Seventh Cross, on which Hans-Ulrich Treichel's text is based. Henze's seven movements reflect the horror and ­anguish of Seghers's ­descriptions; the music is densely ­orchestrated and ­oppressive, the choral writing demanding; there are no soloists. The piece proclaims itself serious, and does so a bit too obviously. This performance conducted by Marek Janowski, though, is good, and ­appears to be the only one available; an earlier EMI version, by Ingo Metzmacher, has disappeared from the catalogue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353383708|2009-10-22T21:32:14|7d1d43e5b73bfa928dea56c4ececee8bd60c5706 --&gt;

            , the oud – and is determined to show that this is an instrument that can match the ­guitar for its range and versatility. As a ­member of the experimental DuOud, Haddab has already proved that the oud can cover anything from soul to electronica, and now comes a furious display of all-out oud rock. Backed by bass, percussion, electronics and guitar, he sets out to match the furious rai-rock fusion work of Rachid Taha, with Taha himself joining in on vocals for the stomping treatment of the Cure's Killing An Arab. This is a band at its best when balancing North African and western styles while ­allowing Haddab's taut and attacking oud solos to dominate proceedings, as with the treatment of another British pop favourite, the Chemical Brothers' Galvanize, or the taut mix of oud, guitar and electronics on the opening Taq on the Beat. The band are less interesting or distinctive when they slow down for the half-­spoken, English-language mood piece Erotic Chiftetelli or ignore the oud for the rock guitar work-out on

            &lt;p&gt;It might seem odd to begin a collection called "Unknown Britten" with Les ­Illuminations, perhaps the best known of his early works. But this performance, taken from a Northern Sinfonia concert with Sandrine Piau as the delightfully idiomatic soloist, includes as an appendix three further Rimbaud settings that ­Britten omitted from the final cycle and left in piano score, which have been ­orchestrated by Colin Matthews. ­Matthews is also responsible for the Movements for a Clarinet Concerto, based on the sketches Britten made in 1942 for a projected concerto for Benny Goodman. The rest of the fascinating disc is made up of fragments and abandoned works more or less as Britten left them. The two pieces from 1930, when the comp
            oser was 16, an untitled fragment for strings and a two-part Rondo Concertante, for piano and strings, show a breathtaking maturity and confidence, while the ­unfinished In Memoriam Dennis Brain pays tribute to the horn player killed in a road accident in 1957 by quoting from the works Britten had composed for him, and a set of variations for piano from 1965 breaks off just over halfway through the planned scheme. No major discoveries, then, but lots of little ­insights into Britten's musical world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353382581|2009-10-22T21:32:14|64bf8649067f0c665de2d3731005b3d78dfc9a01 --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;While Big Star's reputation grows with every passing day, despite 30 years of increasingly unlistenable solo music from leader A
            lex Chilton, the wonder of Rod Stewart's early albums has been overshadowed by the tartan, the blondes and Da Ya Think I'm Sexy. The Stewart box attempts to rectify that perception. Across its 63 unreleased recordings, we learn that a lot of work went into making the lyrics of Maggie May sound so casual, that given a sympathetic setting even Sailing has a quiet majesty, and that Stewart was a great interpreter of other people's songs (the version of The First Cut Is the Deepest is staggering). But the gems are all on the first two discs – and the curious are advised to pick up Every Picture Tells a Story and work from there. The Big Star set, by contrast, gathers virtually all the band's official recordings and supplements them with curios, demos and a live show. The occasional ­individual recording is revelatory – a demo of Downs from their third album reveals the song behind the mess that finally appeared – but its real value lies in showing so clearly how Big Star went from their bright, confident first alb
            um to that ennui-drenched third. It helps that the music along the way is among the very best of the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353402792|2009-10-22T21:32:14|2aa71bc3bdd9ab2dd8fa13cc77e4a0c748eef430 --&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;What seems at first glance a relatively straightforward Mendelssohn disc, played by the orchestra of which he was music director for the last 16 years of his life, and released to coincide with the composer's bicentenary, turns out to be anything but straightforward. There's one obvious novelty in the Third Piano Concerto: Mendelssohn began it in 1842 at much the same time as his ­ ­violin ­concerto but quickly abandoned it, ­leaving two movements in short score and just a few indications of what the ­finale might be. In Marcello Bufalini's ­reconstruction, Roberto Prosseda plays winningly enough, but compared with the fleetness and wit of the two earlier piano concertos, it's a rather lumpish, bombastic work, almost Brahmsian in places, and perhaps ­Mendelssohn ­himself realised its ­problems. But ­
              Riccardo Chailly conducts both the ­familiar Third Symphony, the ­Scottish, and the Hebrides Overture in unfamiliar guises too: the version of the ­symphony Mendelssohn conducted in London in 1842, with a few extra bars here and some different orchestration there, and the first draft of the overture, completed in Rome in 1830. The ­differences are ­telling, though it's the superb performances that Chailly ­obtains from his great orchestra that ­really make their mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353382835|2009-10-22T21:32:14|bb25bfa0b5334d43f8bf090fa3a0f3d9befa0d76 --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Kenny Wheeler, the British Canadian-expat trumpeter and composer, was 77 when he made this album two years ago, but if time now marginally narrows his power (he plays the more user-friendly flugelhorn throughout), his ­improvisations still sound like nobody else's – and his skills as a
            composer/­arranger seem to be blossoming afresh. Wheeler has had a regular association with Italy's accomplished Colours Jazz Orchestra, and he's the principal soloist and conceptual master of this fine ­session, featuring seven standards and one original. There's a recurring pattern, in which loose, often understated and time-juggling overtures evolve into grooving solo sections and then exultant finales, in which the orchestra is given a new set of rich collective variations on the original theme. But it never sounds like a formula, and the sonorities recall all kinds of large-scale jazz, from the Birth of the Cool music via Gil Evans to Maria Schneider. A new star in ­Wheeler's dark-blue firmament is ­Italian singer Diana Torto, a pure-toned ­virtuoso Wheeler deploys as he does Norma Winstone – as an unmannered lyrics singer, as an improvising ­instrument, and as an extra horn within collective jams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not sup

            &lt;p&gt;Girls are two boys – Christopher Owens and Chet "JR" White – whose biographies include stories of being born into a cult, millionaire benefactors and addictions to prescription drugs. The duo combine deceptively simple chords and patterns with hazy walls of feedback, Californian pop melodies, surf guitars and Owens's dozy vocal style – which sounds like he's answering a question you asked him yesterday. The result is glorious. Opener Lust for Life sets the woozy scene before the following 11 songs run off into a sepia sunlight of heartbreak, love, loneliness and partying. Recorded in rehearsal spaces on knackered machinery, the band suggest that had Album been given a proper go it would be even better: "It could have been Pet Sounds," they told this paper.

            &lt;p&gt;Having lost longtime vocalist Sia to a solo career, Zero 7 conceived Yeah Ghost as a predominantly instrumental album, which almost certainly would have rendered it too "chillaxed" for its own good. But sense prevailed, and the duo roped in new vocalists who have shaken the music out of its torpor. Anglo-Zimbabwean singer Eska Mtungwazi, in particular, lights up her tracks with vibrant performances that eclipse everything else here – her foray into Basement Jaxx-ish disco, Mr McGee, is easily the bubbliest moment of the band's career. English folkie Martha Tilston's beautiful delivery of the skittering Pop Art Blue is another highlight, and a rare lead vocal from Zero 7 co-founder Henry Binns gives Everything Up (Zizou) a bright, Britpoppy twist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not su

            &lt;p&gt;What's Barbra Streisand doing on this page, you may ask? Sharing her first ­full-length studio session in four years with jazz singer/pianist Diana Krall's quartet; Krall is also handling the ­production duties. Streisand is even due this week at New York's 120-seater Village Vanguard jazz club, where she hasn't performed since opening for Miles Davis there nearly 50 years ago. She might acquire the lustre of a ­little late-career jazz cool from this ­association, and her delivery of this set of well-travelled standard love songs is as accomplished as might be expected from a diva who didn't sell 140m ­albums and win a skipload of Grammys for nothing. Streisand has Cleo Laine overtones on Gentle Rain; she ­atmospherically whispers Ne Me Quitte Pas against a delicate guitar; and she gets jazzily flexible on Smoke Gets in Your Eyes (even if the stagey
            laugh on the line "so I laughed" betrays her roots). Nevertheless, the album is really a reprofiled Streisand set for her fans, rather than an unexpected ­diversion for jazz ones: Krall's low-key piano is used ­primarily as a hip textural device, and there's a second disc with a Johnny Mandel-­arranged orchestral makeover of exactly the same songs, which shows how ­uncertain they were about really ­shifting the goalposts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353384401|2009-10-22T21:32:14|672fa875ced2a17acf1a9d22e59e2420fdfb9b23 --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It has taken Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony eight years to work their way through the Mahler canon, and this final instalment, like all its predecessors taken from concerts in Davis Symphony Hall, San Francisco, more or less confirms the strengths and weaknesses of the cycle as a whole. Very much on the plus side are the ­superlative orchestral playing, which is as consistently fine and well integra
            ted as in any Mahler cycle currently ­available on disc, and the exceptional dynamic range and refinement of the ­recorded sound, which is demonstrated even more spectacularly than before in the grandeur and aural spectacle of the choral Eighth. Doubts linger, though, about Tilson Thomas's conducting, whose objectivity seems intended to contrast as much as possible with the heart-on-sleeve approach to Mahler epitomised by Leonard Bernstein. Sometimes Tilson Thomas is just too cool and detached for this most ­subjective and self-referential of great composers; there's a whole tragic ­dimension missing to the gloriously played account of the first movement of the Tenth Symphony that prefaces the main work here, while the Eighth lacks dramatic power in the first part, and the gathering sense of inwardness in the second, however beautifully ­balanced and lucid it all is musically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;

            &lt;p&gt;"This ain't no Roxy Music," chirps Hockey's Ben Grubin on the first album by his currently hot foursome from Portland, Oregon. He can say that again. He could also add that, despite the wild-eyed comparisons flying around the internet, this ain't no LCD Soundsystem, either. Mind Chaos is the product of a guitar band who occasionally let their bassist and drummer get into a slouchy, hip-swinging groove (hence the purported similarity to LCD), but mainly stick to the alt-rock blueprint of clanging guitar and sardonic lyrics. Grubin's wordy lyrics will pique the interest of other shy types, but it's the music's freewheeling sparkiness that really hits home: the piano-bashing Preacher, the New Order-influenced thrumming bassline of 3am Spanish and Song Away's punchy choruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 3

            &lt;p&gt;James Chapman, aka Maps, seems to have taken the old Spacemen 3 slogan "Taking drugs to make music to take drugs to" as a motto. The follow-up to 2007's blissful We Can Create documents the effects of stimulants on the human brain. He claims to have done "a lot of research" in this process, which may mean he spent the first album's proceeds getting wasted. He hasn't been wasting his time, though, and Turning the Mind heralds a new Maps sound. In come synthesisers for guitars; there are nods to the dancefloor, angrier lyrics about "cocaine fury" replace melancholia and a general loss of innocence. This is all showcased to best effect on Let Go of the Fear and the Flaming Lips-like I Dream of Crystal. However, at times, Chapman's whispery vocals could benefit from a magic potion of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353386892|2009-10-22T21:32:14|3e3fe195e58a070da3e

            &lt;p&gt;Paloma Faith could have spun from the imagination of novelist Angela Carter. She is theatricality incarnate: an actor, dancer, burlesque performer and former magician's assistant whose natural habitat is the dressing-up box. At least, that's what her CV suggests – there's no evidence of this on her debut album. What its 10 posturing, glittering songs signify is a thoroughly conventional soul, someone for whom taking a risk means visiting the vintage section of Top Shop. Amid the blizzard of catchy choruses, occasional flashes of eccentricity – the rinky-dink opening rhythm of Upside Down, the jewellery-box piano melody of Broken Doll – hint at the performer Faith purports to be. But her protestations of otherness ring hollow when her music is so specious and bland.

            &lt;p&gt;When they emerged in 2007, Empirical made bigger waves and more column inches than any UK jazz ­ensemble since Courtney Pine's early bands. Their ­debut album swept across ­contemporary styles, including funk, gospel and R&amp;amp;B, although the motor that ran it was fuelled by classic bebop, particularly its ecstatic Art Blakey ­derivatives. In this session with guest tenor-saxist Julian Siegel, the American jazz tradition still energises Empirical, in a revised lineup in which the ­excellent Nathaniel Facey's alto sax ­remains dominant but is now in a more laid-back dialogue with Lewis Wright's vibraphone. Facey's fascination with the short-lived and often overlooked sax and bass-clarinet visionary Eric Dolphy shapes the set. Dolphy's edgy sound and bristling melodic lines ­feature on a series of ­ducking and diving tunes, on his own Hat &amp;amp; Beard and on ­Gazzelloni. Out'n'In might seem more of a purist venture than its predecessor, but it is full of sparky variety – from the ­bop
            pish and then free-contrapuntal ­title track, through Facey's and Siegel's intertwining dialogues, the Third Stream-like precision of So He Left, and the freebop and time-switching of ­Dolphyus Morphyus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353384908|2009-10-22T21:32:14|b21cd857e4d86f504a1af6f1fd23c92bf87b9a93 --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The unique Norwegian singer Karin Krog appears with John Surman in ­November's London jazz festival, but this long-unavailable 1968 classic shows just why she gained a reputation as an innovator so early – and why no less a colossus than composer George Russell was moved to write the original glowing liner notes. Krog's ambitious mix of ­sonorous long sounds, girlish glee, ­razor-sharp emphases, bold interval leaps and graceful note-bends (radical surgery applied to highly accessible ­material, including Round About ­Midnight and Maiden Voyage) would be a powerful recommendation on its own. But the set offer
            s other fascinating twists, from fledgling Scandinavian jazz stars Jan Garbarek, Arild Andersen, Palle Danielsson and John Christensen, plus a guest appearance from American trumpeter Ted Curson. Devotees of ­Garbarek's minimalist tone-poetry would be unlikely to recognise his 21-year-old incarnation here, erupting out of these tracks with a molten Coltranesque ­ferocity, but the star is Krog herself. She is eerily funky on Annette Peacock's Mr Joy, wordlessly free on Garbarek's ­Karin's Mode, talky on Round About Midnight, spooky and spontaneous on an electronics-assisted Maiden ­Voyage, and straight-jazzy but ­sure­footedly ­sensuous on Lazy ­Afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353384185|2009-10-22T21:32:14|314733536c75ff5d5b42dce901bc1ce8a60ab34b --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This is the Swiss-Hungarian pianist ­Andrea Kauten's second Schumann disc for Sony. The first, containing the C ­major Fantasy and Kreisleriana, ­apparently appeared last year, though it passed me by. That all suggests that Kauten is a bit of
            a Schumann specialist, and her playing does seem to exude a ­particular affection for and understanding of the ­composer. ­Rich-toned and ­generous with rubato, hers is ­almost an old-­fashioned ­approach, but the ­finesse with which she meets all the technical and music challenges in the sometimes awkward F minor Sonata suggests a keenly ­incisive mind behind it. Unlike many ­pianists these days, ­Kauten plays the Symphonic Studies as Schumann ­published them in 1837, without the five "posthumous studies" he omitted, but were included by his wife in the ­edition published after his death. The work seems more focused ­without them. Two of the Op 21 ­Novelletten are added as makeweights, equally well characterised and ­totally ­idiomatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353383109|2009-10-22T21:32:14|a4d531a5886290769d05e8c3f952aff4f7079bd6 --&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;There is a sense in which fans of Ian Brown are the Bilderberg Group of rock. They are a large, shadowy organisation. No one outside their mysterious ranks really understands their actions or motives, but it's clear they wield considerable influence: enough at least to keep the former Stone Roses frontman thriving in the music business. His career has survived incarceration, ac
            cusations of homophobia and the oft-mentioned but incontrovertible fact that, away from the dulcifying technologies of the recording studio, his voice sounds less like something you'd actually pay money to listen to than something you'd deploy to stop ships crashing into Lizard Point in poor visibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On several occasions over the last decade, the present writer has attempted to go undercover, infiltrating their meetings at the Brixton Academy and the Southampton Guildhall, observing their participation in baffling occult rituals, including cheering wildly as Brown sets about a Stone Roses classic with the blunt instrument of his larynx, leaving She Bangs the Drums or I Wanna Be Adored lying insensible in intensive care, with a doctor by its bedside sadly shaking his head and offering grief counselling to its relatives. They appear to be having the time of their lives, but if you are not of their number, you reel away from an Ian Brown gig as you would from an unprovoked assault in a Yates'
            s Wine Lodge: shaken, confused, unable to work out what possessed you to go in there in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So perhaps the answer to his appeal lies in his albums, of which My Way – his sixth – is a pretty representative example. While in the Stone Roses, Ian Brown wrote – or at least co-wrote – songs of a swaggering perfection. After the Stone Roses split, he started writing songs like a man who'd never actually heard a song before: My Star, Dolphins Were Monkeys. It's hard not think something was lost, but a certain naive charm was difficult to dispute. So it proves here. Opening track Stellify sets out his current musical stall, which is nothing if not idiosyncratic: an odd mid-tempo house thud, topped off with electronics and jangling pub piano. The melody ambles along, weirdly recalling the Grange Hill theme, before a vast horn section crashes into view as unexpectedly as a flying cartoon sausage on a fork. It's a peculiar sonic cocktail on which to base an album, although the most peculiar
            thing about it might be that it works: on the ebullient Just Like You and the gorgeous lope of Laugh Now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, there's a song called Own Brain. As its lyrics helpfully point out, this is an anagram of Ian Brown. You somehow imagine it came about after agonised writing sessions in which he churned out songs called things like Wino Barn and I Warn Nob, but there's something weirdly gripping about the resulting breakbeat clatter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all of his idiosyncracies are as charming. He wastes the album's loveliest melody on Always Remember Me, another unedifying comparison of his fortunes with those of John Squire: there's something about Brown's endless harping on this topic that recalls the guy who spends the evening loudly informing friends that his ex means nothing to him, then goes home and cries in a candlelit room wallpapered with her pictures. We once more encounter his unique brand of protest song, on which Brown expresses an utterly inarguable point in such a clumsily
            hectoring way that you immediately feel impelled to start arguing with it: "Save us from warmongers who bring on Armageddon! Save us from all those whose eyes are closed to the plight of the African child!" he bellowed on 2007's The World Is Yours, causing at least one listener to frantically try to formulate a case in favour of warmongers who bring on Armageddon. This time, it's a gloomily portentous song called The Crowning of the Poor, which socks it to "zillionaires" and leaves you fighting the urge to demand City bonuses be increased a hundredfold with immediate effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It ends with So High, a pastiche of classic southern soul. Given that southern soul is entirely predicated on the singers' ability to convey raw emotion through the incredible power of their voice, you might reasonably assume that it's a genre slightly out of Brown's reach, even if he had the most powerful dulcifying studio technologies known to man at his disposal. But reasonable assumptions count for nothing in the
            world of Ian Brown: he just ploughs through it, with the reckless abandon of a man piloting a battered Datsun in a banger race. As with the rest of My Way, highlights and lowlights alike, you listen to it struggling to think of anyone else who would do this. And perhaps that's the secret of the most mysterious continuing success story in rock.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353384837|2009-10-22T21:32:14|40a60d0bb734de8cec80300ed79b563ec1a66171 --&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Mika might claim his new album represents a more grown-up effort than debut Life in Cartoon Motion, but you only wish his maturing process would gather more speed. "We Are Golden" sets a familiar tone, its Queen-like playground singalong as irritating as it is aggressively catchy. Elsewhere, as on the therapy-themed "Dr John", lyrical soul-searching sits awkwardly with comically over-egged arrangements and that fingernails-on-a-blackboard falsetto. The streamlined electro-disco of "Rain" offers a beguiling dancefloor diversion,
              however, while hushed ballad "By the Time" suggests this stage-school exhibitionist may make an affecting songwriter yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353164363|2009-10-22T21:32:14|76248e96d626d34026feb02dcfd38450a5e7228e --&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Discovered by producer Diplo, to whom they owe the tagline "the South African TV on the Radio", this Johannesburg four-piece counter the usual movement of influence in being an African band inflected by western rock. Which is an inadequate description for their sound: with rhythms that careen chaotically via clattering drums, blasts of jazz trumpets and wild, Hendrixesque guitar solos, an easy listen they're not. Singing in English, Xhosa and Zulu, Lindani Buthelezi is at his most rousing on the magnificent "Lakeside" where sounds and musical ambitions cohere into something intelligible and thoroughly powerful.

                &lt;p&gt;It's easy to see why an oboist should want to steal one of the best bits of Bach's flute music, but it's doesn't quite work: Gonzalo Ruiz is a virtuoso, yet the Second Suite doesn't seem nearly as well suited to his instrument as (for example) the Flute Sonata BWV 1030 in its G minor version for oboe. However, these performances of all four suites, in their imagined early incarnations, are brilliant and incisive. The Third and Fourth, shorn of their brass lines, are especially lithe, with so much more detail audible when there are no baroque trumpets p

              &lt;p&gt;Can you ever really escape your origins? It's a standard dilemma for anyone who's risen from the bottom to the top of the charts, such as Dizzee Rascal, born Dylan Mills in Bow, east London. Still, it's bizarre that embracing a wider audience is still regarded with suspicion in urban music's more earnest quarters when the current American president is pally with Jay-Z, and "Mr Rascal", as Jeremy Paxman called him, pitches up on Newsnight to discuss his inauguration and
              whether he himself may consider running for office. Dizzee's response? "If you believe, you can achieve, innit." A campaign slogan only slightly less substantial than current Tory policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pop is a place where the ins and outs of class, race and gender can be turned on their head. It's also loads of fun. Which is why Dizzee Rascal has settled there after spending four weeks at No 1 last summer, with straightforward party tune "Dance Wiv Me". As he told the Observer last week, he's "trying to honestly reflect what I see in front of me", it's just that the whip-smart problem child who won the 2003 Mercury Prize with his debut Boy in da Corner is now a 23-year-old living large on the proceeds of stardom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His fourth album says so much about being a young man with surplus leisure time, money and lady friends that its natural audience ought to be found in a Premiership dressing room. Hence "Freaky Freaky" is Jay-Z's lascivious "Girls, Girls, Girls" rewritten for the land
              of Benny Hill, where all women are "up for a bonking" and "Chillin wiv da Man Dem" celebrates the only other thing worth doing apart from chasing girls and counting cash - playing video games with your mates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a shallow experience, propelled along by those other excellent singles, the cartoon "Bonkers" and carefree "Holiday", but it's meant to be. As he declares on "Leisure", a broadside aimed at anyone from his old life who thinks he's gone soft, "get off your high horse/ live a little". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he's not entirely selfish and there are enough references to the recession scattered throughout proceedings to suggest the current Dizzee Rascal motto may actually be: laugh now, because the world may not be returning from hell in that handcart. It's reasonable advice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353164362|2009-10-22T21:32:14|3fbf97133

                &lt;p&gt;Ten years after Basement Jaxx's debut, it seems everyone with lungs wants to work with Brixton's dance deities. Album number five boasts 14 guest vocalists, which gives the duo furt
                her licence to display their musical versatility: each track bends towards the collaborator's style. Accordingly, Santogold gets uptempo dub, Kelis gets warped R&amp;amp;B, while the arena-ready dance-pop is reserved for Sam Sparro. "Day of the Sunflowers" is notable for featuring Yoko Ono, but the best beats here belong to Yo! Majesty on "Twerk". In spite of the stylistic fragmentation, Scars sounds entirely consistent and it's the band's most evenly entertaining album to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353170891|2009-10-22T21:32:14|fb4bf3bd1dba52ff11ab2319f8310ed23f9bac95 --&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;This three-disc set of Brahms's four symphonies, recorded live, is outstanding but how or why it should be so good has taken weeks of listening, and comparing with many other recordings, to discover. One reason is that there are no gimmicks, only an impressive fidelity to the score. The orchestra and their chief conductor, Simon Rattle, have reclaimed Br
                ahms as the impassioned master of German Romanticism: beautifully shaped horn solos, richly glowing strings, exquisitely phrased woodwind. Sample, for instance, the slow movement of No 1 for its fervour and for the poignancy of the oboe melody over syncopated strings or simply every note of No 4. In sum, a revelation, which rewards repeated listening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353170434|2009-10-22T21:32:14|6fc963d4f31581c3aac4801e70593a753b2e4d13 --&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;With the exception of the Wind Quintet, one of the sunniest and most relaxed of Carl Nielsen's mature works, none of the pieces in this collection of his wind music is at all substantial. Apart from the quintet, the longest piece here is the witty and rustic Serenata in Vano, for the strange combination of clarinet, bassoon, cello and double bass, which Nielsen composed in 1914. The rest here are either early - the clarinet-and-piano Fantasy and the Fantasy Pieces for oboe and piano - or occasional, such as the miniatures for flute that Nielsen extracted from incidental music he wrote in 1918 for a patriotic play. All are slight, charming, sometimes faux-naif pieces. The real reason for investigating this disc is the New London Cha
              mber Ensemble's account of the quintet, one of the most important in the wind players' chamber repertoire. It's a warmly affectionate, if slightly neutral performance that doesn't quite bring the music into the sharp focus it really needs. Nielsen was at pains to delineate the character of each player in the original group for which he wrote the quintet, but too little of those different personalities emerges here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353068835|2009-10-22T21:32:14|943a415bcb903926a4415a332439cc887938b084 --&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;In the seven years he has been the Berlin Philharmonic's music director, Simon Rattle has made a multitude of recordings with the orchestra. But this set of the Brahms symphonies, recorded in the Philharmonie in Berlin in October and November last year, sets up more direct comparisons than any before with Rattle's two predecessors in
              Berlin, Claudio Abbado and Herbert Karajan, who both made memorable recordings of these works (still available on Deutsche Grammophon) with the orchestra. Though there's no doubting the quality of the playing that Rattle obtains in all four works, nor the sumptuousness of the sound in which the EMI engineers have captured it, the set as a whole is only partially successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best of it is very good indeed. Rattle's account of the Second Symphony has a wonderfully relaxed good humour about it, with the Berlin Phil's fabulous horn section adding lustre to the climaxes, and a finale that positively overflows with high spirits. Much of the Third is equally fine, by turns spaciously expressive and tautly rigorous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The First and the Fourth, however, just miss the mark. Rattle seems not quite to have the measure of the opening movement of the First, which rather loses its way. Though he pulls things together for a thrilling account of the finale, a sense of coherence is still l
              acking. The Fourth, too, has its moments of grandeur, and the Berlin sound in the closing pages of the finale is unquestionably magnificent - yet other strands in its richly complex argument are less well articulated. It's altogether a less complete picture of Brahms the symphonist than either Karajan's or Abbado's set offers; Abbado's performances in particular have a quality of profundity that few recent interpreters can match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353068817|2009-10-22T21:32:14|4e5f6d17e4fdaa2b3ac3913a0c1babf2569504db --&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Since the release of his award-winning debut solo album two and a half years ago, Bassekou Kouyate has been a fixture on the British concert scene, transforming the image of the lute-like ngoni. In his hands, this ancient west African instrument has proved to be as versatile as the guitar, especially when Bassekou suddenly breaks away from the easy, rolling riffs of his ngoni-dominated band for pa
                ssages of furious improvisation. His concerts have been even more exhilarating than that first recording, so here's a second set that tries to redress the balance. Bassekou's shows often start slowly and build up to a crescendo, but this album uses the opposite approach. It starts with the frantic title track, showing off his rapid-fire playing, followed by the urgent Jamana Be Diya, in which he is reunited with Mali's kora star Toumani Diabat&amp;eacute; and that fine griot singer Kasse Mady Diabate. There's more exhilarating solo work on Musow, a song that shows off the impressive vocal work of his wife Amy Sacko, before he calms down for the Bambugu Blues, a slower piece that features the electric guitar work of Vieux Farka Tour&amp;eacute;. This exhilarating set is almost as good as hearing him live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353087601|2009-10-22T21:32:14|e2eeeb2598dd65b3408e

              ;It may be no great novelty any more to hear alt-rock bands taking on African influences (cf Yeasayer, Vampire Weekend et al), but it's still uncommon to hear it happening in the other direction. This terrific Johannesburg band are one such, taking on the forms and functions of proggy, left-field rock as a means of making something new from the music they grew up with - dub, jazz, afrobeat, South African mbaqanga. The result is a dense, towering sound characterised by wild, squalling guitars and galloping, kaleidoscopic rhythms that hover compellingly between frenetic tension and joyous release. There's something of the Mars Volta's surging maximalism in its sheer complexity and noisy exuberance, but the swelling chants, booming brass and overarching sense of melody could only be the result of influences absorbed at home.

              &lt;p&gt;It's tempting to sneer that Milo Cordell and Robbie Furze would never have got an album released, and glowing press coverage to go with it, had they not been the most spectacularly well-connected band in indiedom. Tempting, but unfair. A Brief History of Love is a dazzlingly good debut, carefully mixing guitars and electronics in densely layered and carefully textured songs. Admittedly, this druggy, euphoric music is what caused mickey-takers to coin the phrase "sonic cathedrals of sound" in mockery 20 years ago, but Cordell and Furze - unlike some of their neo-shoegazing peers - understand that a first-rate collection of vintage effects pedals is not a guarantee of success: you need hooks, too. It's not the studio work that will bring listeners back to the likes of Dominos and Love in Vain, it's the skyscraping melodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a

              &lt;p&gt;Jan Garbarek, that most contained of saxophonists, was almost caught shaking his booty at his Festival Hall show with this band in 2007. Maybe the extra thrill imparted by sometime rock drummer Manu Katch&amp;eacute; and the Jaco Pastorius-like electric bassist Yuri Daniel - and an audience reaction rather different to the familiar Garbarek-induced collective trance - triggered ECM's decision to put out the first-ever Garbarek live album. This double CD was recorded in Dresden a month earlier, and it has all the London gig's intensity. Fans needn't fear the banishing of windswept-landscape Garbarek or pensively folk-dancing Garbarek - they appear on the elegiac Twelve Moons and meditative The Tall Tear Trees. But from the eager opening theme of Paper Nut, through the slow-build of Milton Nascimento's Milagre Dos Peixes, to Katch&amp;eacute;'s solo percussion storm on
              Grooving Out! and on to the darkly lyrical encore Voy Cantando, this marks a Garbarek group with impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353068602|2009-10-22T21:32:14|3e8691c0536065d580ab3338500cdf20b02b3eb0 --&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Before 2007's Concert for Diana, Princes William and Harry submitted to an interview with Fearne Cotton, who asked them what kind of music they liked. "Chart toppers … poppy music … good old fashioned bands … listen to anything," they waffled, clearly men for whom music is just something other people play in the background when th
              ey happen to be in the room, which makes events backstage at this years' Wireless festival in Hyde Park seem even more incredible. In a scene apparently scripted by Ricky Gervais, then rejected for being too excruciating, Prince Harry once more evinced his unique take on race relations by striding into Dizzee Rascal's dressing room offering a "street handshake". To his credit, the rapper reacted in the way you might hope a guy from one of east London's racier areas would if a honking Hooray started making with the what-up-blud?, and offered to thump him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here was incontrovertible evidence of how perception of the former Dylan Mills has shifted. Even after winning the Mercury Prize for his debut album Boy in da Corner, it still seemed as if the only way Dizzee Rascal was likely to meet a royal would be if the latter was on an official visit to some kind of secure facility: his lyrical image, after all, rested on being a violent – possibly mentally ill – trouble-magnet. Worse, it seemed very
              much founded in reality. Every time he left his home, his manager recently bemoaned, "guys would come and attack him with concrete posts". And yet, here he is, a regular chart-topper enjoying – or at least enduring – the company of the third in line to the throne. Understandably, his fourth album is a kind of victory lap, a 45-minute revel in the fact that no one wants to hit him with a concrete post any more. It's Never Mind the Bollards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would seem less amazing if he'd achieved this by cynically toning down his lyrics and shamelessly popping up his sound. There are certainly moments on Tongue'N'Cheek when it seems that's exactly what he's done: Dirtee Cash is based around an insanely radio-friendly sample of the old Adventures of Stevie V hit, while on Can't Tek No More, he employs the same edge-of-hysteria voice he once used to announce that he was going to steal your mobile then stab you – but this time it is to huffily complain about the congestion charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However,
              as his recent No 1 Bonkers proves, it's usually more complicated and impressive than that. If it's less wilfully uncommercial than his earlier oeuvre, which frequently made the listener feel like they were being mugged in the middle of an amusement arcade, its distorted synthesisers are still edgily thrilling. The lyrics, meanwhile, return to topics of violence and mental instability but sharpen the gags and leaven the delivery until, unbelievably, they successfully suggest being violent and mentally unstable is an endearingly hilarious state of affairs. It goes without saying this is a pretty incredible feat, but he keeps repeating it, not least on Road Rage, which improbably draws out the humour from the legendarily hilarious topic of dangerous driving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn't always work. Freaky Freaky is nowhere near as enchanting as it thinks it is. It's clearly aiming for a lovable Carry On sauciness, but there's something nasty and glum about its tales of groupiedom, which means it recalls not the
              charming exploits of Sid James and co, but the films that superseded them, in which the sight of Robin Askwith's heaving buttocks was bizarrely expected to render audiences simultaneously helpless with hilarity and lust: it's Confessions of a Gully Skengman. In fact, he often gets unstuck writing about sex. You can understand why he decided to compare his penis to a digeridoo, but it's an unsettling metaphor to place in the listener's mind, not least because you keep imagining Rolf Harris on the end of it. There are also what you might charitably call inconsistencies in his lyrical approach. If you write a song earnestly admonishing people for "living for money", as he does on Dirtee Cash, it's possibly not the best idea to immediately follow it with a song called Money Money, on which you brag about your £850 jeans and your trainer collection and keep shouting "I like cash!", lest people come to the conclusion you're a bit insincere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But at moments like that, the music usually stops you
              from dwelling too long on the flaws. Can't Tek No More boasts a great Aswad sample, Bad Behaviour a gleefully frantic, fuzzy bassline. Like Bonkers and the rest of Tongue'N'Cheek's highlights, it's irresistible in a way that would cause even a former adversary to put down his concrete post and succumb, in a way that even a dim posho who doesn't really like music would get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353109184|2009-10-22T21:32:14|266ec52b7e2ecc6a2d59eafd4770969692140577 --&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Described by the band as "distressed string band music for the 21st century", this is an album of mostly low-key but classy global mood music, performed by a new trio with a ridiculously complex musical history. On acoustic and occasional electric guitar there's Justin Adams, best-known for his work with Robert Plant and his stomping African fusion duets with Juldeh Camara. On saz and cumbus (the Middle Eastern long-necked lute and banjo) there's Lu Edmon
                ds, who has played with everyone from Billy Bragg to the Mekons and is about to rejoin Public Image Ltd, while on mandolin, banjo and other stringed instruments, there's Ben Mandelson, whose extensive CV includes work with Bragg and African bands. They have all played an important role in the development of global music, and here they mix their influences on a set that swerves between European, Middle Eastern, Latin and American styles. Their vocals are low-key, but the instrumental work is exquisite, from the frantic ragtime-east European clash of Ledmo to the stomping title track Phosphor Lane, or an unlikely, brooding treatment of Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353088008|2009-10-22T21:32:14|f9028addb3bcdd070fb6a6afb7cb74190c67fcb5 --&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;With "forces' sweetheart" Vera Lynn at the top of the album chart, the time couldn't be more ripe for Richard Hawley to seduce a mainstream audienc
              e. His sixth album, like its predecessors, comes drenched in nostalgia: the cover portrait is styled after Roy Orbison; Open Up Your Door ends with a melody quoted from Strangers in the Night; there's even a song about hand-writing a love letter by firelight - who does that any more? Opening track As the Dawn Breaks might have been sung by Lynn herself, its mentions of "hope hung on every washing line" and "a songbird's melody" are so evocative of that era. Elsewhere, ghostly cries from the musical saw and ondes Martenot bring an element of eeriness and adventure - yet it's hard to escape a niggling feeling that Hawley is here polishing a formula, even falling back on cliche, in his continuing quest to make the local and homely sound lushly romantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not a news report and may contain views expressed by the author which are not supported by GNM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!-- Guardian Watermark: 353068830|2009-10-22T21:32:14|7b14472f6e71f7ad31a1963aef41a9811f92294f --&gt;
